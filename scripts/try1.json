Farther south on the same continent, Elsa continues to make it snow, but her voice is now that of the Spanish singer Gisela, who proclaims either “<i>suéltalo!</i>” (literally “let it go” in Spanish) or, in the Catalan version that Gisela also sings, “<i>vol volar</i>” (a slightly riskier translation meaning “it wants to fly”).</span><span id=\"more-1599\"></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Traveling east, Elsa’s Italian “<i>Io lo so, sì, lo so</i>” perfectly matches “let it go” in rhyme and prosody. Back in the Americas, this phrase gets changed in to “I’m free”: “<i>libre estoy</i>” in Latin American Spanish and “<i>livre estou</i>” in Brazilian Portuguese. Both of these refrains differ from European translations in the same language, since the European Portuguese translation has Elsa declare “<i>já passou</i>” (“it’s happened”) instead. And across the world, in languages I don’t know enough about to comment on in detail, Elsa sings her song in a polyphony of voices, all equally catchy, all trying to say the same thing in different words.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> As Rick Dempsey, senior vice president of creative for Disney Character Voices, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/02/24/282081061/let-it-go-a-global-hit-in-any-language\"><span class=\"s3\">puts it</span></a>, “we really want audiences to feel like this film was made for them, in their country, even animated in their country—we want the lip-sync to be that good.” And while there might be something unsettling about the notion that an American movie with Anglo-American-looking characters ought to feel as though it was “made for” Brazilian or Chinese people, Dempsey’s got it right. Dubbing provides a unique opportunity to neutralize foreign media because its main purpose is to make the unfamiliar feel domestic. Unlike other forms of audiovisual translation, dubbing is meant to perpetuate the tenuous illusion that what you’re looking at was meant for you, is about you, when in reality it wasn’t, it isn’t.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Films with sound became mainstream around the same time as the Great Depression. Retrospectively ironic but not so funny at the time, the development of sound films presented a deep financial setback for film companies. Until this point, silent films had been easily exportable; all that was needed to bring a film into another language was a change of title cards (or, as was the case with the early films of the Lumière brothers, nothing at all). However, with the advent of sound, the language in which a film was produced indelibly marked its intended audience, limiting its accessibility outside of its country of origin and thereby the profit it could collect. Film translation would now and forever be inseparable from questions of cash.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> The initial response to this problem was byzantine. American companies, leaders in the industry, decided that instead of saving money, they would embark on the hugely expensive project of producing multiple versions of the same movie, all shot in a different language. These movies would feature the identical sets with different actors, reading lines in their language translated from a master script. Sometimes up to 15 distinct versions of the same film were produced. Cinematic Babels, the most famous of which was at Paramount’s studio in Joinville, France, were built exclusively for this purpose. As a French-language article from 1931 describes it, “in this modern studio, everything revolves around <i>sound</i>.” ¹</span></p><p class=\"p3\">Predictably, this grossly impractical manner of production didn’t last for long. Film quality suffered, and producers, realizing their error, adopted less grandiose measures. Paramount began to produce films in one language with a focus on a specific community of viewers, such as a series of Spanish-language dramas featuring the slick, crooning Carlos Gardel. Multiple-language films virtually disappeared as other methods of language transmission were perfected. This was how, its ambitions frustrated, the Joinville studio eventually became a dubbing facility. ²</p><p class=\"p3\">It’s not an exaggeration to say that eighty-five years after Joinville, as American blockbusters are increasingly built for an international audience, good dubbing is more important  to more people than ever. While the American film industry faces resistance in Russia and competition from China, it still controls a gluttonous share of the global market, and overseas consumers regularly provide the bulk of American films’ revenue. A recent <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/22/business/media/after-a-tumultuous-year-at-the-box-office-hollywood-looks-to-2015.html\"><span class=\"s3\">article</span></a> in <i>The New York Times</i> states that the highest-grossing film of 2014 was Disney-Marvel’s <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>, bringing in $639.7 million globally, of which domestic sales only accounted for 45%. Moreover, in a cynical attempt to maintain their global dominance, American movies are now being tightly tailored to overseas markets. <i>Frozen</i> is one example. Another is the Chinese version of <i>Iron Man 3</i>, which featured additional scenes involving Chinese characters that weren’t present in the domestic version. Response to these scenes has been characterized as “mixed.”</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Thus, in a predictable result of trying to export to as much of the world as possible, the way American films are presented to international audiences has become a marker of cultural difference and a topic of constant contention beyond the borders of the anglophone world. In international cinema, a new Babel has emerged, and it’s populated by aliens, superheroes, and singing snow princesses.</span></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align:left;\" rel=\"text-align:left;\">Read Part Two <a href=\"http://theharvardadvocate.com/blog/post/2015-3-26-distortion-the-problem-of-dubbing-in-int/\" title=\"Distortion: The Problem of Dubbing in International Cinema – Part One\">here.</a></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Read Part Three <a href=\"http://theharvardadvocate.com/blog/post/2015-4-8-distortion-the-problem-of-dubbing-in-inte/\" title=\"Distortion: The Problem of Dubbing in International Cinema – Part Two\">here.</a></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>By Lucas Quatrecasas ’18</em></p><p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">¹My translation.

In terms of the overarching themes within the <i>KaylaTV</i> project (which actually extends into the realms of drawing, painting, and photography), the refractions are in dialogue with the multiple iterations of this characterization of the self, <i>Kayla. </i>The different lenses through which you can view this work, including the changes in scale, color saturation, and the disjointing that occurs through projections on objects (such as the projection on the chair), are, for me, a part of the project’s handling of the complex relationship one has with oneself. And on another level, I think that the refractions and reflections and the relationships that are ignited as a result of projections occurring across from each other work in purely a visual and aesthetic sense.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_8424.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_8424\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-850\" height=\"336\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_8424.jpg?w=504&amp;h=336\" width=\"504\"/></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_84521.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_8452\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-854\" height=\"336\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_84521.jpg?w=504&amp;h=336\" width=\"504\"/></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/s1000035.jpg\"><img alt=\"S1000035\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-853\" height=\"284\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/s1000035.jpg?w=504&amp;h=284\" width=\"504\"/></a></p><p><b>What was it like to curate your work?</b></p><p>It was really enjoyable.

Lasky’s lecture, “Poetry and the Metaphysical ‘I’”, focused on the transcendent speaker that can shed identity and slip into any outfit. Lasky argued that boastfulness is ultimately selflessness, empowering the speaker in order to empower the reader; the speaker becomes universal in order to give the reader greater selfhood. Lasky delivered the lecture as part of the inaugural season of the Bagley Wright Lecture Series on Poetry in the Emerson Chapel, where in a commencement address to the class of 1838, Ralph Waldo Emerson urged graduating students to seek a new “teacher … that shall see the world to be a mirror of the soul.”  Lasky’s metaphysical “I” becomes the world that mirrors the reader’s soul, that inspires grit within it vis-à-vis Biggie’s swagger, which becomes generous in “Juicy”’s refrain: “You know very well who you are / Don’t let ‘em hold you down, reach for the stars.”</p><p><span id=\"more-1218\"></span></p><div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1220\" style=\"width: 291px\"><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/lasky-photo-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"lasky photo 2\" class=\" wp-image-1220 \" height=\"405\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/lasky-photo-2.jpg?w=281&amp;h=405\" width=\"281\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lasky talks to members of The Harvard Advocate after her lecture.

Image courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wikipedia.org</a></em></p><p>There was once a time, in high school, when I thought I might be an athlete. Cleaning out the attic the Christmas Break of my freshman year, I came  across a faded, musty photo of my great-uncle’s rowing team. They were all tall and toned and stared grimly at the camera, gripping their oars, their faces determinedly blank and pupil-less. The introductory meeting for my high school’s novice crew team was held at the boathouse down on Kelly Drive: dozens of similar photos cluttered the walls, sepia against wall-paneled oak. There is a quiet exclusivity to a sport that needs a river: I felt its tug of history and decided to enroll.</p><p>The Schuylkill was our playing field, bordered by the Victorian gables of Boathouse Row that lit up at night like gingerbread houses. Our dock was the second-to-last and closest to the waterfall dam; a line of ropes stretched out just in front to cling onto if we drifted too close. It wasn’t a real harbor—the Schuylkill curved into the Delaware, which turned south before the Atlantic—but it was the point of departure and the place of return for our creaky but sturdy eight.</p><p><span id=\"more-774\"></span></p><p>When we began morning practices there were days we had to shovel snow off the dock in the dark before we could take out the boat. The fog clung to the water and left dew on our knuckles. As the days became longer, the sun raced us awake, tugging the mist up from the surface. The deep regular beats of each stroke modulated those mornings. No one spoke for the first hour of practice—I kept my eyes on the inward curve of my knees and the swinging braid of the girl in front.</p><p>My hands broke open, bled, and calloused. I was embarrassed  to shake hands. Some days we never made it to the river: we were sent to the steps of the Art Museum to run up and down until we were told to stop. The first few rounds we talked and acted out Rocky; by the end some of us were in tears. I have never been as hungry as I was that semester. As we waited for the bus to take us home we would dig into our backpacks for change, exchanging grubby dimes for soft pretzels from the roadside stand, fifty cents each. Nothing was more perfect than their delicate browned crust, the salt  nestled into the bread like craters.</p><p>Our coach, Steve, was a house painter. He wore overalls to practice and never joined us during runs. The mentality was reliably us against him. All the time and callouses bound us closer together; we began to speak in the first person plural. The river’s seamy legends seeped under our skin and into our origin myth. There was the eight-boat five years before, just out of our memory’s reach, which had dredged up a dead body with their oars. There were the two boys’ team members who had been horsing around until one fell in off the dock, contracted a parasite, and was hospitalized for a month. The stories breathed consequence into our small victories and defeats.</p><p>My parents came to the regattas and mingled under the tents; my dad started to talk about college and recruiting. He didn’t know, and I didn’t yet tell him, that I was already feeling the nostalgia of an ending. By the next year I would throw out my uniform, revert to classes, clubs, and recitals replacing all those hours. If anyone asked if I was athletic I would laugh and shake my head.</p><p>But that year I was trying out lifestyles on the sketchbook of the Schuylkill. I was part of a team whose alignment had to be perfect for us to move at all.  I was six-seat in a boat on a Philadelphia river as cars raced up the highway on both its sides and over its bridges; no matter how fast we went we’d never catch up. They’d be home by now and we’d still be on the river, yanking, tugging, rowing up and down, not really getting anywhere and with nowhere we really had to go.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

The highlight of the show, for me, was the chance to directly see the work of a prominent young artist who had previously existed – again, for me – only in the cyber-ether, the 28-year-old Colombian-British painter Oscar Murillo. </span><span id=\"more-1660\"></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Likely no one else in America, outside a small coterie of art world dealers, gallerists, and fairgoers, has seen a Murillo painting before this, either. His solo exhibition at the David Zwirner Gallery last year took the form of a chocolate candy assembly line where 13 Colombian workers produced “Chocomelos” (Mallomars without the biscuit layer) for visitors. If the gesture sounds familiar, that’s because it is. Felix Gonzalez-Torres gave away cellophane-wrapped candy, in <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/152961\"><span class=\"s2\">1991</span></a>; Dieter Roth sculpted chocolate self-portraits in the 1960’s; Janine Antoni gnawed off a 600-lb. block of chocolate in <a href=\"http://www.artnews.com/2013/02/21/chocolate-self-portraits-by-janine-antoni-and-dieter-rot/\"><span class=\"s2\">2001</span></a>, and so forth. Despite the social practice underpinnings of Murillo’s iteration, called <i>A Mercantile Novel, </i>surely it deflated the hopes of a public eager to see the canvases of a man dubbed a “soaring star” at 27, when his canvases were already selling for more than $300,000. ¹</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So it was gratifying to see the paintings incarnate. But aside from an interesting presentation of several of his canvases laid out on the floor for museumgoers to handle up-close, all the paintings themselves betray an acute anxiety of, or at least serious debt to, postwar abstract expressionism. (This bears repeating because of the exhibition titular assertion otherwise.) Murillo’s line seems parodic of Rauschenberg and Twombly, and his much-vaunted painted words echo Basquiat, either a sly update spoofing consumer culture at best, or a clunky mimic at worst. In the present corpus, which includes things like “coconut water” and “yoga,” I lean toward the latter.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/murillo_yoga.jpg\"><img alt=\"murillo_yoga\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1663\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/murillo_yoga.jpg?w=670\"/></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Untitled (la era de la sinceridad), 2013. Silkscreen, oil paint, oil stick, aluminum foil, dirt, and copper. 61 x 41 1/4 inches (155 x 105 cm)</em></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align:left;\"><span class=\"s1\">Several long and unfocused profiles of Murillo reach for some limpid honorific like “Radiant Child,” as which René Ricard christened Basquiat. But the next Basquiat will not look so… Basquiat. “Bomb style packages itself.” ²</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It is remarkable that Murillo’s art still “looks like art” – the supreme criteria for work on the market today – nearly twenty years after this look debuted. </span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">But my misgivings about his painting and inconsistent exhibited content were largely swept aside when I learned of an ingenious performance he recently concluded in Brazil, which was one of the most potent gestures in global art of the last few years. Murillo was invited to a residency, at collector Frances Reynolds’s Rio de Janeiro-area mansion, ending in September 2014. He was struck upon arrival that nearly all the domestic staff were black, and subsequently spent the entire residency wearing a white jumpsuit working alongside them in the house. (Murillo worked for several years as a cleaner to support his wife and son after graduating from art school.) He revealed this fact at a party concluding the residency at the mansion, having hung the dirty jumpsuit outside, and gave a speech in which he “</span><span class=\"s3\">chastised the country for what he perceived to be blatant ‘colonization.’</span><span class=\"s1\">” ³</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/72-26-_01_b02_new-betterlight-from-ben.jpg\"><img alt=\"72.26 _01_B02_New BetterLight from Ben\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1661\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/72-26-_01_b02_new-betterlight-from-ben.jpg?w=670\"/></a></p><p class=\"p4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Robert Rauschenberg, Collection, 1954/1955; oil, paper, fabric, wood, and metal on canvas, 80 in. x 96 in. x 3 1/2 in.

Murillo apparently brought Reynolds to tears, and was heckled with questions about social practice, Latin American artists, and the market therein. The ArtForum “diary” entry from the evening blithely notes that “</span><span class=\"s3\">guests tried to enjoy the outdoor party after the polemical address, but it wouldn’t be so easy.</span><span class=\"s1\">”</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The action itself is poetically forceful, in the Aristotelian sense. I mean, it is intrinsically so elegant that no retelling of it would diminish its impact. Where I had, rightly or wrongly, dismissed Murillo as a willing participant in the gross machinery of art market forces – a young, brown, working-class receptacle for the desires of the [nearly all-white] patrons, gallerists, and curators who desperately want not to miss the “Van Gogh boat” (“the idea of the unrecognized genius slaving away in a garret”) – Murillo revealed an exquisite self-awareness. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The performance fleshes out the mystifying treatment he has received by kingmakers like the prominent art-collecting couple, Don and Mera Rubell. The pair almost single-handedly thrust Murillo into the spotlight after spotting his work in 2012, visiting his studio, buying numerous paintings, and giving him studio space in their Miami home. Their commentary on the artist in a <i>New York</i> profile is alarmingly tone-deaf. “People are always trying to figure out what the power of the immigrant is…the power of the immigrant is that they always show up. You don’t always know if you can deliver, but you always show up. Oscar always shows up,” offers Mera Rubell. Elsewhere she compares his haircut to a “movie version of Basquiat’s” haircut, no doubt central to his initial appeal. The pair is certainly generous and hugely supportive of numerous young artists, but they are illustrative of the problems with contemporary patronage, and of why it is so difficult to encounter substantive explorations, or even incorporations, of race, gender, identity, and class in today’s fine art. I suspect a vast quantity of art that does this simply does not read to patrons like the Rubells. How could it?</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/the-nile.jpg\"><img alt=\"the-nile\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1664\" height=\"318\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/the-nile.jpg?w=670&amp;h=318\" width=\"670\"/></a></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Jean-Michel Basquiat, The Nile, 1983; acrylic and crayon on canvas, 172.5 x 358 cm; Collection Enrico Navarra.</em></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are so many extant questions I have about Murillo’s performance. Were his co-workers aware that he was the artist-in-residence? If not, were they primed not to expect the resident “artist” at Reynolds’s mansion (presuming there had been others) to have dark skin and speak Spanish? Which party guests, exactly, tried to dismiss his performance by invoking Paula Cooper as totemic of social activism in the art world? Where is the jumpsuit now, and might it be exhibited again? The white jumpsuit, blowing in the breeze, as it did at the party, would be a one-work exhibition stronger than the composite MOMA assemblage. What, exactly, is “atemporal” about living and art-making as a person of color, it would ask. Almost nothing. Staking a claim to non-historical existence is a privilege of the precious, white few.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><em>By Krithika Varagur, ’15</em></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/art/9768/where-life-meets-art-oscar-murillo-at-the-south-london-gallery.html\"><span class=\"s2\">¹ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/art/9768/where-life-meets-art-oscar-murillo-at-the-south-london-gallery.html</span></a> </span></p><p class=\"p1\">² <span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">René Ricard, “The Radiant Child,” </span><i style=\"line-height:1.5;\">ArtForum</i><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">, December 1981.</span>  <a href=\"http://artforum.com/inprintarchive/id=35643\" style=\"line-height:1.5;\"><span class=\"s2\">http://artforum.com/inprintarchive/id=35643</span></a></p><p class=\"p1\">³ <a href=\"http://artforum.com/diary/id=48336\" style=\"line-height:1.5;\"><span class=\"s2\">http://artforum.com/diary/id=48336</span></a></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

This clever, vexing novel follows an anthropologist named U. working for a corporation whose leader asks him to </span><span class=\"s4\">“</span><span class=\"s5\">write the Great Report… the Book. The First and Last Word on our age… What I want you to do, he said, is <i>name</i> what</span><span class=\"s4\">’</span><span class=\"s5\">s taking place right now.</span><span class=\"s4\">”</span><span class=\"s1\"> This assignment forms part of the Koob-Sassen Project, an enterprise so big and insidious that </span><span class=\"s2\">“</span><span class=\"s1\">there</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s probably not a single area of your daily life that it hasn</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">t, in some way or other, touched on, penetrated, changed; although you probably don</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">t know this.</span><span class=\"s2\">” </span><span class=\"s1\">So, bopping about Europe and working on this report, U. floats between half-baked revelations about the Internet and the suicidal undertone of parachuting before arriving in Manhattan</span><span class=\"s2\">—</span><span class=\"s1\">which he</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s imbued with central significance by way of a Borgesian dream-sequence</span><span class=\"s2\">—</span><span class=\"s1\">only to realize that when he gets there, nothing happens. It</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s a novel of sexy ideas, none of which fully reveals itself before becoming something new.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I’m a longtime McCarthy fan, and for those who are too, I think it’s safe to say that <i>Satin Island is </i> more of a distant cousin to his 2005 <i>Remainder</i> than a logical follow-up to his 2010 <i>C</i>. But what concerns me is not so much defining <i>Satin Island</i>‘s place in McCarthy’s work as understanding its structure among works like it. Why? Because, despite its seeming improvisation, this type of plot</span><span class=\"s2\">—</span><span class=\"s1\">the plot that writers like Jonathan Franzen typically avoid by way of dramatic structure so tight it would make Aristotle blush</span><span class=\"s2\">—</span><span class=\"s1\">has an ample tradition. It’s everywhere, actually. If you pressed me to describe its structure, I</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">d say it</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s as though one of the great meta-detectives novels of our time (Haruki Murakami</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s <i>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and The End of the World</i>, Thomas Pynchon</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>, or Paul Auster</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s <i>The New York Trilogy</i> are all good examples) took a wrong turn in its controlled universe of clues and twists, questions and answers, and ended up in a surreal landscape like those of Yves Tanguy, where nothing has any weight and everything seems to be slowly falling apart.</span>¹</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/download.jpeg\"><img alt=\"download\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1780 aligncenter\" height=\"158\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/download.jpeg?w=300&amp;h=158\" width=\"300\"/></a></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In fact, novels like <i>Satin Island</i> have less in common with the literary mysteries cited above than with the novels of Roberto Bola</span><span class=\"s2\">ñ</span><span class=\"s1\">o or films like Paul Thomas Anderson’s adaptation of Pynchon</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s <i>Inherent Vice: </i>detective fiction so meta it</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s transcendent and so soft-boiled it</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s practically uncooked. Like Pynchon’s stoned detective, this type of story follows a series of false clues and fanciful asides before resolving a central problem unsatisfactorily, wonkily, forcing you to realize that its subject is not that obscure object of desire but its relentless chasers.</span><span class=\"s2\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">Dragging along U.</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s rote sex life (“I tried to have sex with her again, but she wasn</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">t interested; she just finished off her cigarette…”) and the progressive death of his (only?) friend, <i>Satin Island</i>, like Mathieu, chases a sublime understanding of the desired object, but doesn’t catch it. It’s as if Mathieu were on a mission to define the intricacies of the late capitalist landscape and the answer were “Conchita.”</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This style has its virtues; first among them is that it furnishes pretext for unrelenting subtlety. Attitudes, atmospheres, and general vibes are given exquisite attention while allowing scenes to linger in a haze of detached mirth. Nothing really <i>has</i> to happen, so nothing does. As U., the narrator of McCarthy’s book warns early on, “<i>events</i>! If you want those, you</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">d best stop reading now.” Instead, to move itself forward, the story relies on a constant climate of low-level dread and metaphysical anxiety. Roberto Bola</span><span class=\"s2\">ñ</span><span class=\"s1\">o</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s novels epitomize this technique. Take his monstrous cast of characters in his 650-page <i>The Savage Detectives</i>: often, instead of generating the events that form a good story, Bola</span><span class=\"s2\">ñ</span><span class=\"s1\">o</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s characters simply predict future events</span><span class=\"s2\">—</span><span class=\"s1\">vague ones</span><span class=\"s2\">—</span><span class=\"s1\">that are generally undesirable and bad-sounding. Here, giving off high levels of dread, one such character forecasts the shadowy destiny of Bola</span><span class=\"s2\">ñ</span><span class=\"s1\">o</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s two protagonists Ul</span><span class=\"s2\">í</span><span class=\"s1\">ses and Arturo (the eponymous detectives) and the novel as a whole.</span></p><p class=\"p3\" style=\"padding-left:60px;\"><span class=\"s1\">“Now let</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s take the desperate reader, who is presumably the audience for the literature of desperation. What do we see? First, the reader is an adolescent or an immature adult, insecure, all nerves. He</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s the kind of fucking idiot (pardon my language) who committed suicide after reading <i>Werther</i>… Furthermore: desperate readers are like the California gold mines. Sooner or later they</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">re exhausted! Why? It</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s obvious! One can</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">t live one</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s whole life in desperation. In the end the body rebels, the pain becomes unbearable, lucidity gushes out in great cold spurts… I told them [Ul</span><span class=\"s2\">í</span><span class=\"s1\">ses and Arturo] so. I warned them… I alerted them to the dangers. Don</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">t exhaust the vein! Humility! Seek oneself, lose oneself in strange lands! But with a guiding line, with bread crumbs or white pebbles! And yet I was mad, driven mad by them, by my daughters, by Laura Dami</span><span class=\"s2\">á</span><span class=\"s1\">n, and so they didn</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">t listen.”</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The reader is thus hooked; she keeps reading, waits to see whether these predictions are right. What will happen to Ul</span><span class=\"s2\">í</span><span class=\"s1\">ses and Arturo? Will their bodies give out to their desperation? And what about that bit about the suicide? Might they fall into a similar trap? Similarly, consider McCarthy</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s portentous description of U.</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s in-flight sleep after he</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s watched a television report on an oil spill:</span></p><p class=\"p3\" style=\"padding-left:60px;\"><span class=\"s1\">“… oil seemed to lie around the very cloud-patches the wing-lights were illuminating: to lurk within and boost their volume, as though absorbed by them, and to seep out from them as well, in blobs and globules that hovered on their ledges, sat about their folds and crevasses, like so many blackened cherubs.”</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Or of the ventilation system in his office, in which the novel</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s entire argument is contained:</span></p><p class=\"p3\" style=\"padding-left:60px;\"><span class=\"s1\">“It was cavernous and booming… Other, vaguer voices hovered in the general noise</span><span class=\"s2\">—</span><span class=\"s1\">or if not voices, at least patterns, with their ridges and their troughs, their repetition frequencies, their cadences and codas. Sometimes these patterns took on visual forms, like those that so enchanted eighteenth century scientists when they scattered salt on Chladni plates and, exposing these to various acoustic stimuli, observed the intricate design that ensued… I, too, in my basement, sometimes thought I saw… the plan, formula, solution… before, waking with a jolt, I watched it all evaporate, like salt in a quiet breeze.”</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">McCarthy</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s talent for dread</span><span class=\"s2\">—</span><span class=\"s1\">that feeling of something big lurking beyond the present, something whose contours you can only make out for a second</span><span class=\"s2\">—</span><span class=\"s1\">is enough to power his novel too. Yet, at the same time, when these portentous monologues go on for 26 chapters, as they do in<i> The Savage Detectives</i>, or last an entire book, as in <i>Satin Island</i>, the reader</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s anticipation often becomes boredom</span><span class=\"s2\">—</span><span class=\"s1\">albeit a happy boredom which pleases us because it’s still fueled by foreboding. As Adam Phillips observes in his psychoanalytic classic <i>On Kissing, Tickling, and Being Bored</i>: </span><span class=\"s2\">“</span><span class=\"s1\">For the adult, it seems, boredom needs to be the more permanent suspended animation of desire.</span><span class=\"s2\">” </span><span class=\"s1\">Reading, we know that nothing is happening, and yet we</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">re helplessly strung along by the desire that something might. ²</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/download-1.jpeg\"><img alt=\"download (1)\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1781 aligncenter\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/download-1.jpeg?w=670\"/></a></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Nine Nights</i> by Bernardo Carvalho is another novel that <i>Satin Island</i> recalls, not only for its sedated plot or its critical preoccupation with an anthropologist, but for the productive way it deals with this desirous boredom. First published in 2002, Carvalho</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s book is a documentary-paced presentation of a twenty-first-century novelist</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s failure to explain the life and death of Buell Quain, an American anthropologist who after graduating from Columbia studied the Krah</span><span class=\"s2\">ô </span><span class=\"s1\">people in Brazil before killing himself among them in 1939.³</span><span class=\"s1\"> Needless to say, there are no events here. The novelist spends almost the entire text weighing hypotheses on Quain: was he </span><span class=\"s2\">“</span><span class=\"s1\">racked by illness</span><span class=\"s2\">”</span><span class=\"s1\">? Was he </span><span class=\"s2\">“</span><span class=\"s1\">in mortal danger</span><span class=\"s2\">”</span><span class=\"s1\">? Is it true that he </span><span class=\"s2\">“‘</span><span class=\"s1\">Forced himself into homosexuality with blacks, of whom he has a horror</span><span class=\"s2\">’”</span><span class=\"s1\">? Even when the book</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s exciting, it</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s boring. Yet, while McCarthy’s anthropologist is meaningfully engaged in watching videos buffer or Carvalho’s novelist is yet again insinuating that Quain was in fact functionally insane, the reader feels this boredom just as strongly as she shares the characters</span><span class=\"s2\">’ </span><span class=\"s1\">exquisite desire. Just as Mathieu</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s frustration is partly pleasurable since it represents the anticipation of a reward, our boredom is partly pleasurable since it waits for the moment in which the book runs out of secrets to keep. This is the moment in which the book either greets its reader with open arms or slithers away, Conchita-like, unwilling to admit to its reader that its story has collapsed.</span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Nine Nights</i> does the first while <i>Satin Island</i> does the second. This is why <i>Nine Nights </i>wonderfully eschews the smirking tone of a novel driven mostly by ideas. Unlike <i>Satin Island</i>, which ends with U.</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s clever musings on a homeless man trying to use a payphone</span><span class=\"s2\">—</span><span class=\"s1\">U. finds him </span><span class=\"s2\">“</span><span class=\"s1\">anachronistic,</span><span class=\"s2\">” </span><span class=\"s1\">perhaps highlighting U.</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s own confusion in defining the present</span><span class=\"s2\">—</span><span class=\"s1\"><i>Nine Nights </i>ends almost tragically, as though the narrator (and Carvalho himself) were sad that he couldn</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">t offer you more. After losing his time to reconstructing a Buell Quain that increasingly seems more like a man on a perverse and nostalgic voyage than an anthropologist, the narrator finds himself on a plane back to Brazil.</span></p><p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align:left;padding-left:60px;\"><span class=\"s1\">“Coincidentally, we were flying over the region where Quain had killed himself. That was when the guy next to me, for the first time, paused and asked me if his light was bothering me. I said no, I could never sleep on planes. He smiled and said he couldn</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">t either. He was too excited about his trip to sleep… I asked him if he was going on holiday. He smiled again and responded proudly and enthusiastically: </span><span class=\"s2\">‘</span><span class=\"s1\">I</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">m going to study the Brazilian Indians.</span><span class=\"s2\">’ </span><span class=\"s1\">I couldn</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">t manage another word… I suddenly remembered learning, on one of those television shows about ancient civilizations, that the Nazca of the Peruvian desert cut out the tongues of the dead and tied them up in a bag so that they could never return to torment the living. I turned to the other side, fighting my own nature, and tried to sleep, even if only to quiet the dead.”</span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He has good reason to want to quiet the dead; he</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s failed to understand Quain, and what</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s more menacing than a voice beyond the grave accusing you of having given up on them? I’ve been saying that <i>Satin Island</i> is propelled by the same erotic, aimless anxiety found in Bola</span><span class=\"s2\">ñ</span><span class=\"s1\">o and at the thematic core of <i>That Obscure Object of Desire</i></span><span class=\"s2\">—</span><span class=\"s1\">an anxiety that collapses yet doesn’t resolve. This is true of <i>Nine Nights</i> insofar as the voyeur’s desire to know what sordid (or totally banal) secret led Buell Quain to kill himself in Brazil is what makes the novel’s disparate episodes cohere. But as opposed to McCarthy’s characters (who are so hollow they would be more appropriately called <i>concepts</i></span><span class=\"s2\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">or <i>specters</i>), those of Carvalho have a harrowing fullness to them: as a reader, you follow their emotional logic; you get what they’re going through. There’s a bitter sincerity in their quest, a sincerity all but overlooked by McCarthy’s novel and perhaps more apparent in Bola</span><span class=\"s2\">ñ</span><span class=\"s1\">o’s gruesome and redemptive <i>2666</i> than in <i>The Savage Detectives</i>.</span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In one of <i>Nine Nights</i>’s more touching scenes we learn that Quain’s ceaseless traveling was for him a way to “try to come back to himself, to a place where he would no longer be forced to see himself” and his death a shortcut to this self-blindness. Such stylistic illogic will be familiar to readers of Bolaño—how exactly does one “come back to himself” by projecting himself endlessly elsewhere, with the biggest elsewhere being death?—but more important, it echoes a familiar and durable literary sentiment, perhaps best distilled by Baudelaire in his memorab</span><span class=\"s4\">le lines, “This life is a hospital where every patient is possessed with the desire to change beds… It always seems to me that I should feel well in the place where I am not.” Similarly universal is the notion that Quain’s “own self took him by surprise.” Who hasn’t felt that? When we read these quips, it’s clear that we’re not just dealing with McCarthy’s existential limbo but with some heavier, more personal stuff: movement as self-hatred, stillness as self-alienation, and desire of the foreign as migration toward death.</span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This is neither better nor worse at a literary level, but it makes for a better read. And it makes it all the more lamentable that Carvalho’s not as well-known around here as Bola</span><span class=\"s2\">ñ</span><span class=\"s1\">o (or as McCarthy for that matter). There</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s something beautiful about writing that knows both when to confuse and when to capitulate—it keeps both writer and reader honest. Are U.</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s scary predictions about insidious corporate influence in our lives correct? Was Buell Quain a fetishist with father problems? In books as meandering as these, as in the case of Conchita and Mathieu, the best revelations are those that disappoint you by being exactly what you knew but didn</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">t want to believe.</span></p><p class=\"p2\">By Lucas Quatrecasas ’18</p><p class=\"p2\">¹ <span class=\"s1\">For more on <i>Satin Island</i></span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s rapport with surrealist tendencies like those of Tanguy and Bu</span><span class=\"s2\">ñ</span><span class=\"s1\">uel, check out McCarthy</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s interview with two cats <a href=\"http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1104929/st-my-cats-read-a-feline-conversation-with-tom-mccarthy\"><span class=\"s3\">here</span></a>.</span></p><p class=\"p2\">² <span class=\"s1\">For what it</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s worth, James Wood recognizes both of these novel-forwarding devices in an essay on </span><span class=\"s2\">“</span><span class=\"s1\">Thomas Pynchon and the Problem of Allegory</span><span class=\"s2\">” </span><span class=\"s1\">(included in <i>The Broken Estate</i>, 2010).

Although this last point is of little relevance to the present essay, I</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">d say that the allegorical skeleton of <i>Satin Island</i> is at points disturbingly visible and that equating dream-logic with one</span><span class=\"s2\">’</span><span class=\"s1\">s personal paradise is practically what made Bola</span><span class=\"s2\">ñ</span><span class=\"s1\">o famous. </span></p><p class=\"p2\">³ <span class=\"s1\">Vintage published an English translation of <i>Nine Nights</i> in 2008.

It seems people don’t make claims like that very often anymore and, sometimes, I think that’s a shame.</p><p style=\"text-align:left;\">Why is it that translators are so often driven to attempt precisely those passages that seem so perfect in their original language, so untranslatable? Perhaps it is because translation feels most necessary when it is most impossible.</p><p style=\"text-align:left;\"><span id=\"more-240\"></span></p><p style=\"text-align:left;\">I could say that I am drawn to translating these lines because they deal with the same issues facing a translator: the speaker, a herdsman named Meliboeus, is leaving his native land (and taking his song with him), while Tityrus creates an echo of his own voice, spreading his song at the risk of distortion. And it must be the image of the forest. As a translator of Walter Benjamin writes:</p><p style=\"text-align:left;\">“Unlike a work of literature, translation finds itself not in the center of the language forest but on the outside facing the wooded ridge; it calls into it without entering, aiming at the single spot where the echo is able to give, in its own language, the reverberation of the work.”</p><p style=\"text-align:left;\">So I send my translation to the woods, hoping that its echo picks up some Vergilian timbres along the way. It’s found some dactyls, at least.</p><p><strong>Vergil’s <em>Eclogues</em><em> (1.1-5)</em></strong></p><p>Tityrus, you lying back underneath the shade of a beech tree<br/>\nspreading open, on a thin stalk of grass you try the song of the forest.<br/>\nI go beyond the ends of my fatherland, leave these sweet fields<br/>\nbehind—I flee from my fatherland; you, Tityrus, calm in the shadow,<br/>\nteach the forests to echo <i>Amaryllis is beautiful.</i></p><p><i>Tityre, tu patulae recubans sub tegmine fagi<br/>\nsilvestrem tenui musam meditaris avena.<br/>\nNos patriae finis et dulcia linquimus arva.<br/>\nNos patriam fugimus; tu, Tityre, lentus in umbra</i><br/>\n<i>formosam resonare doces Amaryllida silvas.</i></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

		"body" : "<p>The clouds wear the last pinks of a fallen sun. I’m reclined on a gusty, deserted beach, letting prickles of numbness build up in my arms.</p><p>It’s my last evening up on the top of Australia, and I’m a frightened child. Everything can kill you here. I heard talk of a plant that can lodge its stinger in you and cause constant pain for years. Crocodiles skulk like serpentine abominations in medieval paintings. A row of dense bush behind me seems keen to muffle screams.</p><p>It’s gorgeous, though: a perfect cove, lightly pitched so the water strays up high and forms thin, silvery pools. Plus, it’s my last night in Cape Tribulation before returning to Cairns, and, from there, Sydney. The rugged individualist within who has pushed me this high on the continent picks me up from the sand for one final wander into a mangrove grove in the last light.</p><p><span id=\"more-388\"></span></p><p>Mangroves are giant gnarled fists clenching the sand, and for several minutes I’m tangled in their knuckles. Then I’m through. A celestial plane of still seawater warps smoothly around my shoes. Floating driftwood reptiles laze nearby, but with a sweep of the eyes I’m consoled. This is a scene that steps me back so that I watch myself watch it. There’s something eternal about this beach; it’s embossed with the glow and fade of endless days. I am nothing but timely crud.</p><p>Suddenly, the lowness of the light has got me worried. The wind is bitter. I shiver in the tropical paradise. I gaze along the bush and realize I’ve wandered far. There is a wide parabola of beach to cover, gripped at the vertex by mangroves. And then there’s the short bush walk to the car.</p><p>I begin walking urgently, so that the thin pools splash up in protest. The water keeps me from running. It’s dark enough now that the driftwood specks wriggle with lack of definition. I wonder what a crocodile sounds like.</p><p>I reach the mangroves, now a nightmarish thicket of slippery limbs. It looks like tangled souls in a Doré print of Dante’s <i>Inferno</i>. I remember gazing at one as a kid, unable to focus on anything, to grasp anything but excess, convolution, nakedness: a mess of members. Now I am forced to traverse the living grove in the hellish half-light. I emerge muddy and mishandled. Dark has fallen, so I begin to run.</p><p>Running across sand is like running in a dream. I feel the urge to fall on all fours, lash at the sand and slither, anything to propel me forward but this horrible, tethered striving. Crocodiles have mastered sand-bound locomotion, lubricated missile of torso sliding along as deceptively powerful frog legs thrash in concert at the ground. I kick up clouds of dust and stutter forward.</p><p>The stars are out, and I realize I’ve come too far. I leer at the bush before me but see no outlet. There’s a parking lot somewhere within all this bush. My car’s there. These are the two tenets that stand between me and hysteria. They are backed by an unassailable truth: I arrived here somehow. But then where is the path?</p><p>I double back, now cursing aloud and periodically emitting a breathy whine that scares me. The bush in this direction is just as solid. Then an opening yawns before me. I squint into the black and step down a small ridge. There’s mud under my feet that I don’t remember. Something makes a small tinkling. I realize there’s a deathly still swamp at my feet, a few shades blacker than what surrounds it. I leap back across the ridge and run, convinced there’s something abysmal behind me.</p><p>Surrounding me now is the prospect of dying alone and nowhere. It takes days to be missed out here; information travels slowly, in discrete, limited jumps. I could spend the entire night searching the bush for the path as crocodiles slip soundlessly out of the water to feed. I pluck up the courage to make one last methodical pass of the bush before despairing.</p><p>The waves rush, and the trees hiss. Strange insects chide the night. I pant, squint, and wave a service-less cell phone like a madman. Eventually the shaft of a jellyfish warning sign glints in the bluish light. I’ve found the path.</p><p>As soon as I sit in the driver’s seat of the rental car, I begin the process of trivializing my fear. Obviously I’ve reached the car, so obviously there has been nothing to be afraid of. This is the attitude I assume every time I recount the story: it all worked out, no worries. For better or worse, fear is only legible from the inside out. From the outside, it’s only so much noise.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Image courtesy of whitney.org</em></p><p>In the spring issue of <i>The Harvard Advocate</i> are two features, <a href=\"http://www.theharvardadvocate.com/content/motel\" target=\"_blank\">“Motel” by Georgina Parfitt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theharvardadvocate.com/content/collisions\" target=\"_blank\">“Collisions” by My Ngoc Toc</a>, whose titular pairing is irresistible. What kinds of collisions spawn a motel? Destroy one? What kinds of collisions occur daily within?</p><p>Parfitt describes three days spent in and around a buttery-yellow Rest Inn Motel; Toc riffs on the event of collision, which she approaches, avoids, and actualizes in a variety of contexts. Reading the two features in tandem brought me to mind of a contemporary phenomenon and an artistic representation thereof: the implosion of old hotels to make way for new (prevalent, until recently, in Las Vegas), and Richard Artschwager’s <i>Destruction</i> series, which depicts the implosion of the Traymor Hotel. The collision in question is bipartite: the violent meeting of future and past, and the deathly embrace of dynamite and architecture.</p><p><span id=\"more-970\"></span></p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Historical Hotels</i></p><p>Under the National Trust for Historical Preservation, <i>Historical Hotels of America</i> recognizes and advertises hotels throughout the country for their commitment to preserving the past. Their members make claims to having housed the likes of Katherine Hepburn, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and combatants in the Civil War. The Beekman Arms and Delamater Inn of Rhinebeck, New York, prides itself on being the oldest hotel in America, allegedly founded in the early 1700s by William Traphagen, when the town was known by its Dutch inhabitants as “Ryn Beck.” It is rumored that George Washington, Alexander Hamilton and Benedict Arnold slept, drank, and waxed revolutionary there. A Rhinebeck native, I proudly echo the Beekman’s insistence on superlatively historical roots, and some cursory research has assured me that, while other hotels do make claims to the same (as I feared), th’ol Beekman always falls somewhere in the ranks of oldest. To preserve landmark hotels is to sustain the memories made under their roofs. Someone important, we convince ourselves, breathed this air, tread these floorboards, grazed these walls with blessed sleeves. By inhabiting their old haunts, we grow nearer to our dead icons; we share a place in common. Unlike the physical luxuries of hot tubs and plush beds, which coax us into expensive solipsism, knowledge of a hotel’s history breaks down its walls, extending present into past and realizing present as the past for a future to come.</p><p>Yet not all hotels share this drive to preserve.</p><p><i>Enter collision number one:</i> <b>Future meets past.</b></p><p><i>And collision number two</i>:<b> Dynamite meets architecture.</b></p><p>As Toc puts it: “one object travels at such feverish high speed, and is so much more massive, that it will devour the other.”</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Dunes’ Doom</i></p><p>In contrast to the <i>Historical Hotels of America</i>, there exists another philosophy of success in the hospitality industry: one that erases the past and looks to the future, erodes the old and flaunts the new.</p><p>Equipped with the slogan “The Miracle in the Desert” and an Arabian Nights aesthetic, the Dunes hotel in Las Vegas thrived for forty years before its life-span was cut short by antsy profiteers. Built in 1955, the hotel saw many an acclaimed entertainer loiter in its lobby, among them Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, and the Minsky’s Follies. By the 90s, however, its revenue had fallen as it couldn’t compete with the shinier resorts that had sprung up since its midcentury heyday. In October, 1992, it was purchased by Steve Wynn. In 1993, the Dunes hotel, Miracle in the Desert, was imploded by six hundred pounds of dynamite. Or rather, “exploded” by a pirate ship from Treasure Island Hotel and Casino, as the spectacle was staged to appear. The 1.6 billion dollar Bellagio resort sprung upward from its ashes.</p><p>In the fifteen years following the demise of the Dunes, twelve other Vegas hotels were demolished in like fashion—the cycle of implosion and construction a regenerative process perfectly suited for a city allergic to decay (might I say <a href=\"http://theadvocateblog.net/2013/04/05/symposium-boredom/\" target=\"_blank\">boredom</a>) and addicted to marvel. The old made room for the new. From dust to dust, or something like that.</p><p>Most implosions attracted large audiences, and that of the Landmark resort was made explicitly cinematic by its appearance in the film <i>Mars Attacks!.</i> While I would expect as much from spectacle-hungry Vegas-goers, I, personally, would find it hard to abstract the wonder of a collapsing building from events that have attached themselves to images of the same. In my opinion, the demolition of the Desert Inn’s Augusta Tower, for instance, is too reminiscent of that of the Twin Towers to engender applause. In the midst of violence and intentional destruction, I think the least we can do is preserve what we have.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>A Celotex Conclusion</i></p><p>I’d like to conclude with what got me started: a tableau entitled<i> Destruction IV</i>, which was on display at Artschwager’s Whitney retrospective last summer.<i> </i>Painted with acrylic on the characteristically Artschwagerian Celotex, it depicts the demolition of Atlantic City’s Traymore Hotel in 1972, carried out despite campaigns for its preservation. Mediated first by a newspaper photograph, and then by the fibrous Celotex, the painting both distances and slows the explosion. In grainy black and white, the crumbling demands not cheers but meditation. We are forced to pause and knit together shades of grey to realize its totality.</p><p><i>Destruction IV</i> preserves the past by recording its destruction for the future to witness. It slows down our “feverish high speed” by demanding stillness and careful observation. It de-glorifies demolition by presenting it unexplained, leaving for the viewer all the associations that the explosion is apt to provoke.</p><p>The painting is rendered even more powerful by what directly followed its display: Artschwager passed away just a week after the closing of the show that commemorated his life’s work. Unbeknownst to the Whitney, it, like Artschwager, was recording a life on the precipice of death.</p><p>Parfitt’s feature goes some way in painting an alternative to destruction’s false sense of regeneration: allowing the future to stretch out before us, and the past to be revisited. As she describes, “The sun enters in ribbons. I fall back asleep. The day stretches out in front of me.” Then, as she stands at the train station, considering leaving, she muses, “Any of these places are places I could go. Instead, I turn back, away from the platform, in the direction of The Rest Inn Motel.”</p><p>Supposedly since 2007 Vegas has turned to renovation as a means of remedying stasis. Perhaps the destructive trend truly has seen its end, and we’re finally catching up to the past.</p><p> </p><p><i>Reach The Harvard Advocate’s Spring Issue <a href=\"http://www.theharvardadvocate.com/category/archive/spring-2013\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a></i></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Pretty empty. It’s late Sunday, and most people who had a choice chose to fly earlier in the day. Outside, the runways have gotten all nostalgic with the sunset.</p><p>There’s a delay, but I don’t know what it’s for. I keep following the pattern in the carpet: <i>X</i>s on a green base, the green lacking just enough blue to miss turquoise. I’ve been here a lot. These <i>X</i>s are stuck in me: I can’t imagine an airport without them now.</p><p>I’m trying to convince myself of something.</p><p><span id=\"more-1090\"></span></p><p>I said goodbye to my mother an hour ago, my sisters an hour before that. I was only here for a little while. I’m going back to work tomorrow in San Francisco. A few weeks left before school.</p><p>The <i>X</i>s are mesmerizing.</p><p>Something isn’t right. I don’t feel well.</p><p>*</p><p>Coming back into SF is smooth. I like it here at night. Even in the summer it’s fogged and cold. Two guys smoke cigarettes off the corner of the BART station at 16<sup>th</sup> and Mission, and the smell is comforting. Even late on the street, door-grates still slide open from the apartments.</p><p>Nothing feels real here, at night. Drift through it. It might be raining, it’s hard to tell.</p><p>I’m into my apartment. Lights up. My room has no decorations on the yellow walls, just a bed with rumpled sheets. This place is empty. I won’t be in it for long, like I said. Get ready for bed and turn off the lights.</p><p>Even though I didn’t expect to, I care about someone here. A boy I met at work, Sebastian. He’s more of a stereotypical programmer than I am. I asked him once about an awning on a building, and he told me he didn’t know what that word meant. “Awning.” He says he doesn’t use words to communicate like I do. He just types hard, banging on his keyboard (Dvorak, not Qwerty layout), and software comes.</p><p>Sometimes we’re the same, though. A little contrary. With a habit of not giving a fuck about things, a habit of giving too much of a fuck about other things. He quit last week. We don’t work together any more.</p><p>Sebastian is enough to make me want to stay here, in the city. The work itself isn’t good enough though. It’s fine, it’s useful, it’s instructive, but not enough.</p><p>This is the problem. I don’t want to stay, and I also don’t want to go back to Cambridge now or in two weeks or anytime soon. I have enough money saved up that I can go away for a while; have a part-time job that I can do long-distance. For some God-only-knows reason, here in the dark in my apartment trying to fall asleep I feel it in waves, the need to move. Something pushes outward.</p><p>*</p><p>“I’d miss you, but that shouldn’t stop you. You might never get to do this again.” I’m Skyping with a friend. It’s exactly the right thing for her to say. I turn away and try to make it easier.</p><p>I haven’t felt not-lonely, here or at school, only sometimes busy enough to forget. I wasn’t made for other people. But now I’m afraid to leave.</p><p>Fight off an outburst: that the only fucking reason I haven’t peaced out already is you, that you’re why I’m still in my skin after all this. That’s not right either — too emotional. Over the top.</p><p>Just nod. “I don’t know how to do this.” So choose.</p><p>*</p><p>This is terrifying. Walk by the moon through Dolores and I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m not happy, I wasn’t happy, I want to be somewhere else, somewhere old, where the age in the buildings can give me a little more steadiness, somewhere hard and different with people I don’t know, just a green place that doesn’t feel as comforting as a pill. I romanticize it.</p><p>I can see most of the city from the top of this hill, plus palm fronds in the lower part. They’re just figures in the dark. A train car rumbles when it comes by. Then quiet. No one nearby. On top of the city with it all stretched out in front, something expands. Same as in the airport with the <i>X</i>s like sunspots in my eyes. Just a feeling, starting in the core of my stomach and seeking out.</p><p>There isn’t anything keeping me. There also isn’t anything that I’ll find over there.</p><p>Only the empty place, a box with green-near-turquoise carpet on the bottom, hollow and fragile, where I can walk for a few hours. Stare down, make something and then forget. Count the <i>X</i>s. Become silhouetted. Darken, turn away, leave it undone and abstract. Start again.</p><p>So choose.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

		"slug" : "2012-11-23-fever-stallone-in-one-take",
		"body" : "<p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">Why does Stallone have to take the offer? Most importantly, he doesn’t have a cent over $106 in the bank. In fact he’s already had to sell his dog, and not even to make a profit. He just couldn’t afford the dog food anymore.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">On the one hand, in 1975 Stallone considers himself lucky to have $106. Five years earlier, when he went broke and got thrown out of his apartment, Stallone slept in the Port Authority Bus Terminal for three weeks. Flipping through job listings on an empty stomach, he saw a casting call for a film called <i>The Party at Kitty and Stud’s</i>. He auditioned and got cast as Stud. After that paycheck Stallone was never homeless again, but he also never forgot that he’d been reduced to small-time porn.</span></p><p><span id=\"more-342\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">On the other hand, United Artists is offering him $20 thousand for his screenplay. Burt Reynolds wants to play the protagonist. Rejecting the offer for Stallone isn’t just saying no to 188 times his present net worth. It’s saying no to his first, maybe only chance to break out of the unremitting failure he’s faced in seven years of writing and acting. In all this time he’s done nothing but try: Stallone’s painted the windows of his apartment black and thrown out his phone to focus better on writing dialogue.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">So Stallone <i>has</i> to take this offer. But that doesn’t mean he actually will. You see, Stallone wrote the lead role for himself. That fighter isn’t just some symbol or movie God. That fighter is Stallone. The character, whoever plays him, is the seed of a celebrity creation myth.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">Stallone to the studio execs: I’ll work for free if you cast me. Studio execs say that they can’t cast a nobody. They up the offer to $80 grand.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">No.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">Okay, okay, they say that they’re also thinking about casting Redford. If Redford’s interested, they’ll go up to $200 grand.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">Redford wants to play the lead. $200 grand.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">No.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">Would Stallone take $300?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">No.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">$330?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">No.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">$360?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">No, says Stallone, you’ve got to understand. I would rather throw myself in front of a train than see this movie succeed without me. Stallone’s given birth to this beautiful baby and they can’t buy it from him just to make someone else the father. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">Fine. United Artists pays Stallone $340 a week along with $20 grand for the script. After taxes and agent fees, that lump sum goes down to $8 thousand. The budget is so strained that Stallone shoots the boxing scenes all in a single day. The key scene, when Rocky tells Adrian that he’s been a <i>nobody</i> his whole life, that he just needs <i>to go the distance</i> with Creed, is nearly cut. When the studio finally agrees to finance the shoot, Stallone is given just enough money for one take. It’s all he needs.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">The story is its own film, and its underdog looks a lot like Rocky himself. Now when Stallone tells his tale fans and journalists eat it up. It’s the best American cheese they’ll ever find. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">By Alexander Traub ’13</span></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Max joined critic and Harvard professor James Wood to discuss David Foster Wallace in an event co-hosted by the Advocate and the Mahindra Humanities Center earlier this month. See <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsbKT50ud04\">footage</a> from the evening </i><i>or read a <a href=\"http://ofa.fas.harvard.edu/wordpress/?p=14135\">recap</a> of the event by former Fiction Editor Patrick Lauppe ‘13.</i></p><p>“The proof of a poet is that his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbed it,” Walt Whitman concluded in his now-treasured preface to the first edition of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. I recalled this conclusion while reading <i>Every Love Story is a Ghost Story, </i>D.T. Max’s new biography of David Foster Wallace. Though Whitman and Wallace seem to occupy distant intervals on the writerly gamut, to me Max’s biography portrayed Wallace as an exemplar of Whitman’s “proof of a poet” statement. Through the biography, the reader absorbs Wallace’s life page by page, and in turn the pages illustrate ways his readers—the nation—slowly soaked into him. Whitman likely did not intend and could not have foreseen such a relationship: Whitman came to epitomize “e pluribus unum” (one from many), while Wallace repurposed our nation’s de facto motto into “e unibus pluram” (many from one).  Wallace aimed to pick up the splinters of the American psyche that had been united, then fractured, in the years since Whitman. The story of how Wallace arrived at his ultimate failure, <i>The Pale King</i>, can be substituted as “the proof of a poet” where the novel itself failed.</p><p>In the preface to <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, Whitman was responding to the paradigms set forth by Ralph Waldo Emerson, in “The Poet,” an essay published eleven years earlier. In that essay Emerson expressed the nation’s need for a visionary who would both articulate and embody the grace and grandeur of America and her people.  But Whitman’s preface was more than a response to Emerson—it was a solution. It served as his statement of intent: to epitomize the qualities Emerson had described, becoming “The Poet” Emerson had so lucidly summoned. A resounding voice of the nation, Whitman met Emerson’s expectations along the way to fulfilling his own. For Whitman, “absorbing” the nation affectionately was a matter of becoming the nation. It is this ethos that engendered “Song of Myself,” which, as the heart of his poetic project, is perhaps the closest we have to an American epic. “I am large, I contain multitudes,” Whitman as narrator declares; “I act as the tongue of you.”</p><p>But this self-as-whole, individual-as-universal notion is only one of many ways to read Whitman’s “proof of the poet” dictum. Throughout Wallace’s biography, D.T. Max allows readers to celebrate Wallace’s life, comprehending the complex writer with newfound affection regardless of whether they have read his work. In turn, the biography describes Wallace’s monumental dedication to his readers, and the ambitious final project undertaken in the name of his readers: the project that ultimately became his demise. These reciprocal processes, though they take place outside the immediate realm of the author’s work, form the mutual “absorption” Whitman’s dictum required.</p><p>The absorption would not be possible if Max had not distinguished the author of <i>The Pale King</i> from the writer who came before, showing how Wallace’s final years were arguably his most insightful. In those years he was more stable than he had ever been, in a functional marriage and in a rewarding teaching position. But the ambition of his final novel loomed large. In his head, his novel was years overdue. In writing <i>The</i> <i>Pale King, </i>Wallace was solidifying answers to all the questions with which he had grappled since the beginning of his career—regarding the novel’s many ambitions, Max writes, “It had to show people a way to insulate themselves from the toxic freneticism of American life. It had to be emotionally engaged and morally sound, and to dramatize boredom without being too entertaining.”</p><p>Emerson contended in “The Poet” that all poetry “was written before time was,” and that in attempting to write, most will miswrite the truth. Wallace, with his colloquial style that newly captured the fragmented experience of late-20<sup>th</sup>-century American life in <i>Infinite Jest</i>, is one of Emerson’s “men of more delicate ear [who] write down these cadences more faithfully, and these transcripts, though imperfect, become the songs of the nations.” But the Wallace who wrote <i>The</i> <i>Pale King</i> was unwilling to concede to imperfection, unwilling to publish the cosmic pulses he intuited until all their points of inflection had been precisely located.</p><p>Although sentences of Whitman’s preface and Emerson’s essay may describe Wallace, Wallace’s image hardly aligns with their transcendentalist visions of the great American bard. But the Wallace of <i>The Pale King </i>ought to. Wallace was characterized by inconsistency—his Midwestern sincerity and straightforwardness seemed at odds with his verbose and elliptical writing style, and yet his motives for <i>The Pale King</i> might reconcile the irregularities. Max hinted at this conflict when detailing the ambitions of <i>The Pale King</i>, noting that the novel “had to sidestep the point that the kind of personality that conferred grace was the opposite of Wallace’s own.” The story of Wallace’s ultimate battle becomes a powerful stand-in for his failed novel’s ambitions, and it shows us the many ways in which his personality, in all its contradictions, is the <i>only</i> kind that might confer grace upon his readers today. Max writes, that <i>The Pale King </i>“was [Wallace’s] effort to show the world what it was to be ‘a fucking human being.’”  Where his final effort foundered, his story might nearly succeed.</p><div>\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"/>\n</div><div>\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"/>\n</div><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Image courtesy of makeyourideasart.com</em></p><p>Here they come: three stone-faced bootleggers with their shirts tucked into their coveralls driving Chevys out of the laurel to sell moonshine in bottles in the pavilion parking lot. Here they come: the three of them now finished with their breakfast, their stomachs full of biscuits and gravy and kraut. <i>Here they come</i>, my friend says. He tells me they come here often.</p><p>We’re seven miles from the highway. It’s just past dawn. Some farm kids are out running dogs. The first bootlegger jabs the air with his index finger: <i>No-no-no, it’s the special pussy, man, way back in the back</i>. Which part of a truck bed is the back? I lift the tarpaulin further along and my friend quickly moves for a different set of jars — is he guessing? The second bootlegger heaves back with his kitchen table drawl: <i>Boss uh-huh boss</i>. I guess he’s not guessing. The third bootlegger, an Iraq vet, explains he’s been drinking hooch since his mother first tried to get rid of him in utero by chugging two quarts of it.</p><p>They ask my friend and I if we’ve ever drunk moonshine before. I lie.</p><p><span id=\"more-990\"></span></p><p>That great grains have for a long time been illegally distilled in these parts of Virginia is manifest — literally everybody makes their own grain liquor here, including the preacher. Winos stir it in their coffee. Mothers put it in their children’s eggs so they don’t get so runny. Larger batches double as an effective cleaning agent.</p><p>The Feds hate all of it. It costs them millions. In schools here children learn that moonshine laws are holdovers from the Prohibition and, before that, Hamilton’s whisky tax. <i>Ferment away</i>, they say. But you have to pay $13.50 a gallon if you want to distill.</p><p><i>What a lark</i>, mocks the first bootlegger. It’s such an easy rule to skirt.</p><p>I once overheard a woman shopkeeper at a nearby gas station advising a passing traveler on how to make proper shine: ferment fifty percent sugar and fifty percent corn then distill until its ripe enough to gas your car twenty miles. No aging needed, but maybe add a hedge of damson berry for flavor. Or if you want something with a more florally taste you can use barley instead of corn. Rye is spicy and big.</p><p>If it’s clean as lime, your drink will carry you around all day long.</p><p>The first bootlegger says <i>c’mere </i>and pulls my friend and me aside all buddy-buddy. He’s an honest-to-god outlaw and good salesman. <i>First off</i>, he says, <i>if it’s legal moonshine, it’s probably just some Everclear knockoff for the snoops up in the North</i>.<i> </i>You’re not going to get your money’s worth. <i>You also got to avoid the rotgut crap</i>. That’s that heavily sugared brew that makes amateur stillers go blind and die — pure methanol made in old car radiators — <i>the crap</i> he says our moms probably warned us about. I want his stuff because it’s private stock. He puts his hand on my shoulder: <i>Pure corn liquor is always private stock.</i></p><p><i>Look</i>, my friend says, shaking a jar in his hands.<i> No head.</i></p><p>It’s hard not to romanticize. The two of us come to this part of the state for camping and the baby-blue swimming holes on Hyco River. That evening we sip the liquid from brown jugs and cook biscuit dough over a pine-bough campfire. Embers fly like beetles and fall onto dirt. We rub them into the ground with our shoes.</p><p><i>This is the life</i>, my friend says, <i>and the South is very old</i>.</p><p>It is very old. I readjust my seat.</p><p>Good moonshine comes at you like a bowie knife: point first, dulling your senses the deeper and deeper it goes. It’s like walking backwards. You step back away from something, say, a river. Your vision gets lost in the river — the carp and the mud. Then the river gets lost in the hills, the hills in the mountains, and the mountains in the sky. The sky grows wider, the mountains flatter. Somewhere in the center is still the river, of course, but you can’t be bothered to recall where.</p><p>For a minute you might even forget your toes.</p><p>We’ve all been drunk, but 160-proof grain liquor is a different kind of play. It only takes a few ounces for even the meanest backwoods drinkers, men who knock back a pint or more a day for forty years, to feel it whop down in their skulls, as if something scooped out the brain matter and poured in napalm. Some say it’s downright evil. <i>Twenty bucks a gallon</i>, the second one had told us. Our cotton shirts are soaked from the summer heat. Or is it because of the fire? The radio mutters words in a language we don’t understand. The dough is done. Someone blows on a harp.</p><p>My father never drank moonshine, nor his father or grandfather, which means I’m the first man in my family in at least three generations to touch the stuff. Shakespeare probably never drank moonshine either — whisky perhaps. Still, the guy gets credit for popularizing the name — <i>moonshine.</i></p><p>In Act V of <i>The Tempest</i>, Prospero soliloquizes one last time: <i>You demi-puppets that by moonshine do the green sour ringlets make</i> (V.i.38-39). He describes the great feats of magic he has performed in his life but that he will do no more, including harking the planets from the sky and planting toadstools by moonlight. I like to think of moonshiners as the old Prospero’s acolytes — disenfranchised magicians spurned for their nighttime tricks, grump devils cast down. Incidentally, the soliloquy marks the end of Shakespeare’s solo writing career.</p><p>We’re used to hearing the drunkard’s story — the drunkard who grabs onto your arm and pants, <i>I did this and it was so interesting</i>. This next series of posts will come from such inebriates among us — the moon-dogs, the poisoners, the magicians, the smugglers, the lunatics.</p><p>However, it’s better to think of our stories as fiction, for one can never be too wary of the law. Indeed, I never met three bootleggers outside a camping pavilion in the Virginia piedmont. They never sold me six full jars with the affront “XXX” written on them in Sharpie, the old joke.</p><p>Furthermore, I never overheard a woman shopkeeper — the one from the gas station. And as the traveler handed her cash for a 20oz. Pepsi and chips, she never mentioned that years ago the mayor of her county seat, drunk on moonshine, shit on his kitchen table and burned his house to the ground.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

He contributed poems to the <em>Harvard Monthly </em>and <a href=\"http://theharvardadvocate.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The</em> <em>Harvard Advocate</em></a> (in his own name as well as under the pseudonym of R. Jeffries, according to biographer George Lensing), and was elected president of the <em>Advocate </em>in his final year. His poetry would not be published again until 1914.</p><p>Stevens’ first book of poetry, <em>Harmonium</em>, was published when he was forty-four; scholars tend to agree that he completed his greatest works relatively late in his career. But Stevens’ three years at 54 Garden Street in Cambridge, Mass. were the setting for his self-conscious cultivation of an artistic identity. His interactions with Harvard professor, philosopher, and poet George Santayana; his membership in the <a href=\"http://www.signetsociety.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Signet Society</a>, an undergraduate arts and letters society; and his participation in various publications helped to initially shape his poetic consciousness. The tension between reality and the ideal, for example—a theme that would prove central to Stevens’ poetry—is already present in the pieces reproduced here. Encouraged by his father, Stevens would leave Harvard for law instead of art; but these relics prove that as a young man he was already a poet and, perhaps more significantly, thought of himself as one.</p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/photo-15.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-320\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/photo-15.jpg?w=670&amp;h=312\" title=\"photo-15\"/></a></p><p><em>Published in </em>The Harvard Advocate, <em>Vol. LXVI, No. 10 (March 13, 1899)</em></p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/photo-161.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-322\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/photo-161.jpg?w=670&amp;h=369\" title=\"photo-16\"/></a><em>Published in </em>The Harvard Advocate, <em>Vol. LXIX, No. 1 (March 10, 1900)</em></p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/photo-17.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-332\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/photo-17.jpg?w=670&amp;h=500\" title=\"photo-17\"/></a></p><p><em>Published in </em>The Harvard Advocate, <em>Vol. LXIX, No. 5 (May 10, 1900</em>)</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

It has sometimes been observed in the field, where about a quarter of male-female encounters results in the males being eaten by the female.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-43\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis#cite_note-43\">[43]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Hurd_44-0\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis#cite_note-Hurd-44\">[44]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-45\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis#cite_note-45\">[45]</a></sup> Around 90% of the predatory species of mantises participate in sexual cannibalism.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-46\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis#cite_note-46\">[46]</a></sup> Adult males typically outnumber females at first, but their numbers may be fairly equivalent later in the adult stage,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Capinera2008_5-2\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis#cite_note-Capinera2008-5\">[5]</a></sup> possibly because females selectively eat the smaller males.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-47\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis#cite_note-47\">[47]</a></sup>In <i><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenodera_sinensis\" title=\"Tenodera sinensis\">Tenodera sinensis</a></i>, 83% of males escape cannibalism after an encounter with a female, but since multiple matings occur, the probability of a male’s being cannibalized increases cumulatively.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Hurd_44-1\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis#cite_note-Hurd-44\">[44]</a></sup>\r\n</p><p>The female may begin feeding by biting off the male’s head (as they do with regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male’s movements may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion\" title=\"Ganglion\">ganglion</a> in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male’s head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior appeared to be an artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_libitum\" title=\"Ad libitum\">ad libitum</a></i>(so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in a courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Liske_48-0\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis#cite_note-Liske-48\">[48]</a></sup> Under such circumstances, the female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing the colored eyespots on the inside of her front legs.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Lelito_49-0\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis#cite_note-Lelito-49\">[49]</a></sup>\r\n</p><p>The reason for sexual cannibalism has been debated; some consider that submissive males gain a selective advantage by producing offspring. This theory is supported by a quantifiable increase in the duration of copulation among males which are cannibalized, in some cases doubling both the duration and the chance of fertilization. This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time, indicating that males which actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females. The same study also found that hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-50\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis#cite_note-50\">[50]</a></sup> The act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males, for at this time, females most frequently cannibalize their mates. An increase in mounting duration appears to indicate that males wait for an opportune time to dismount when the female is hungry, so is likely to cannibalize her mate.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Lelito_49-1\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis#cite_note-Lelito-49\">[49]</a></sup>\r\n</p><p>(Source: Wikipedia)</p>",

Sleep\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-929\" height=\"491\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/kayla-escobedo-illustration-advocate-sleep.jpg?w=504&h=491\" width=\"504\"></a></p>\r\n<p>A friend and I diverge in our attitudes about sleep. Ever the pragmatist, the utility of her sleep is a function of what it will allow her to accomplish in her waking hours. After it has served that purpose, its value quickly diminishes, and sleep as a leisure activity is little more than a waste of time. An allocative inefficiency.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, I think sleep has its own, self-contained merit. Ask a recreational traveler about their hobby, or maybe more accurately ask a coin collector, a wine connoisseur, for a sense of this perspective. Every interval of sleep is different, like every fingerprint. Eight-hour spans that pass like the blink of an eye, so sudden they cut you off mid-thought. Long, lazy naps that leave you feeling sick and heavy. Jagged-edged insomnia like a broken-off branch. Clean sheet sleep.</p>\r\n<p><span id=\"more-924\"></span></p>\r\n<p>And of course, dreams. I know people who paint their dreams. Who, when describing them, get a look like they are re-immersed by the telling. Who are pleased by their mind’s ability to create outlandish and disturbing events without effort or intent. I’m not like that. My dreams are, for the most part, mundane. Occasionally something fantastical will happen, or frightening, and I count myself lucky for those moments. Usually, though, my unconscious mind simply enacts thoughts or conversations I’ve already imagined all day, just with better production value.</p>\r\n<p>The most unusual dreams I ever had were on Mefloquine, a malaria prophylactic with gentle neuropsychiatric effects. I was in Tanzania for three months, and though the village in which I was based was elevated high enough that mosquitoes were not a problem, I still broke the pill out of its foil and swallowed it with iodine-tinted water once a week. The goofy travel doctor warned me that I might have “visions of demonic sugar-plum fairies,” and I had to hope his example was autobiographical. But I think the medicine just boosted me to the average strangeness of other people’s dreams, peaking on Mondays when I took the pill and tapering to the usual banality as the week progressed.</p>\r\n<p>The real advantage was that each time I woke up, I could recall dreams, enough to notice that for weeks, all my dreams were of Philadelphia. Can you really say you are in a place when, each night, you go home? Believers say that ghosts are spirits with unfinished business, and I understand the logic embedded in the lore.&nbsp; I had left home with things unsaid, and I could not stop going back and saying them, and saying them.</p>\r\n<p>I remember the happiness I felt nearly a month into the trip when I woke up from a nightmare about a lion pawing at the door to the house: the Tanzanian house, not my family home. That is to say, after weeks, I had finally arrived. Though the Philadelphia dreams never completely ceased, in the nights that followed, I started dreaming more of the place where I went to sleep, not the city still two months and seven thousand miles away, which was a relief: it had been exhausting.</p>\r\n<p><em>Illustration by Kayla Escobedo ’13</em></p>\r\n<div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\r\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\r\n<div class=\"u\">\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"u\">\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\r\n</div>",

I work two days a week for minimum wage, and business varies— mostly slow in the afternoons, despite the droves of tourists who have discovered this idyllic pocket of suburban Los Angeles where my father, and his father, grew up. </span><span id=\"more-1791\"></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">This summer is particularly hot; the kind of heat where you are only ever half-comfortable submerged in the ocean’s soft waves, watching the menacing heat shimmer far away on the on the volleyball courts where players dance, hopping from side to side as their feet burn. The beach is a block down from the storefront where I stand sweating, and sometimes I close the shop for half an hour in the middle of the day to cool off in the water, compelled by my merciless allegiance to the power of those waves.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">As a third-generation Angeleno, the beach culture is as ingrained in me as the surf-wax is pressed into the smooth fiberglass of the longboard hanging on the ceiling of our garage. Most of my childhood days, like those of my dad and my grandma, were spent on the beach. My twin sister and I would stay on the sand for hours, the air heavy with the scent of Coppertone, until our hair turned blonde and our skin turned brown. The salt, from hours of diving into the whitewash, dried and clung to our eyebrows and eyelashes like beads of early morning dew. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The shop sells only surf trunks. Their fabric is slippery and thick, practically indestructible with virtually no stretch—the brand, Birdwell, is from ‘61, and the store, with surfboards and photographs adorning the wall, is a time capsule. Stiff, unforgiving shorts don’t seem ideal for cutting into the clear Pacific on a hot day, but people love them. Customers come in and solemnly declare their love for the brand, the ocean and its magic. Countless stories spill from the mouths of every person who walks in, how they’d worn these all summer, every day, as a kid, in SoCal, the east coast, Biarritz. Their shared love for the water connects their separate stories and gives life to these blazing afternoons.<a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/grandma-and-grandpa-on-highland-and-marine.jpg\"><img alt=\"grandma and grandpa on Highland and Marine\" class=\" wp-image-1792 aligncenter\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/grandma-and-grandpa-on-highland-and-marine.jpg?w=419&amp;h=285\" width=\"419\"/></a></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In the bantam town of Manhattan Beach, everyone knows each other, and my family, who has been here since the 30s, is at the center of it. My grandmother’s perpetually tanned skin and salty hair carry the stories of a now evolving city, and I’ve always called her the unofficial mayor. As a kid, she’d often walk me home from school along the bleached sidewalk near the water, and we’d make a game of counting how many familiar faces and friends she’d run into. The count seemed to be ever-increasing and constantly impressive, especially for the 7-year old I was, whose world, by comparison, felt hopelessly small. In its earliest days, the beach town was a ten-mile stretch of ocean frontage, a hotspot for volleyball and surfing, with a wooden pier on Marine Avenue. Downtown was once a hardware store, a movie theatre, drugstores, and a post office: a seaside town with no real plan, just the water, and a place to buy a five cent burger before falling into the sand.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The pier’s still there, volleyball is ever-popular, and my grandmother still knows everyone, somehow.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>But it’s difficult to ignore the inevitable changes the small town has gone through in even my lifetime here, as tourists come from everywhere, and coffee chains, designer boutiques, and real estate offices replace local storefronts and icons. In the past twenty years it’s become a destination for professional volleyball tournaments, fine dining, and designer shopping. Manhattan Beach feels less and less like our little secret, where waves and boardshorts rule- the only worry ever really being when we’ll get down to the water where the pier stands grounding the city. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">It isn’t surprising when a woman, Kerry, walks into the store and says she knows who I am from photos she’s seen: the granddaughter of Rose, the daughter of Matt. Another familiar face, a friend my grandma would recognize if we still walked the journey from school to home together. We talk story for several too-hot hours, both of us standing huddled in the doorway, her passionate words like colored ink splashing onto the pages of a simpler city I have never quite known like she has. Her brother was my father’s childhood best friend, the three of them inseparable. Their days were an endless cycle of riding bikes in a circuit, home to school to the beach, ending at the volleyball court on Marine Street to meet my grandparents with a bucket of KFC, before getting one last swim in before sunset. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/marine-ave-skate-pic-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"Marine Ave skate pic 2\" class=\" wp-image-1796 aligncenter\" height=\"275\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/marine-ave-skate-pic-2.jpg?w=405&amp;h=275\" width=\"405\"/></a></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I have heard stories of Manhattan Beach in the 60’s before—a much more laissez-faire vibe than today. My father shares memories of Birdwell-clad surfing and broken-armed skateboarding, stories of proms in white polyester jackets, snippets of college life paired with a diet of M&amp;Ms. But Kerry’s stories and passion surprise me. She moved away from the South Bay before even entering the fifth grade, to somewhere up North, Sacramento maybe. Yet she expresses a love for this place in a way I don’t usually hear, even from my grandmother who’s been here for almost 70 years. She feels a magic even more defined than when she lived here years ago—a love for the city, a fire fed by nostalgia and longing, a spell she cannot shake, despite the changes she’s seen. I was five years old when my parents told me the sand crabs had left on vacation to Hawaii so that I wouldn’t be afraid to get in the water. Our conversation reminds me of my parents’</span> <span class=\"s1\">white lie, and I pinpoint it as the moment I too began feeling the magic of this place, and fell in love with the water, the sand, the beach.<a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/marine-st-skate-pic-4.jpg\"><img alt=\"Marine St skate pic 4\" class=\" wp-image-1798 aligncenter\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/marine-st-skate-pic-4.jpg?w=417&amp;h=282\" width=\"417\"/></a> </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">It was easy to believe that the magic of this town had left when new shops moved in and parking became impossible to find. After all, it wasn’t the beach my family had known, and I was ready to go, without a second thought about leaving behind the gritty sand and salty spray of the ocean. But I’ve come to know that the magic of this place is real and true. Like a siren’s song luring wayward sailors, it is strong, especially when I have left and come back again. When I first landed, I drove south from LAX on Pacific Coast Highway, heading home after my first year away. The ocean and its briny scent beckoned to my right, the vast highway dotted with glowing taillights stretched before me. The air was warm and heavy with that special midnight fog, and I took a sharp right down Marine, heading for the Pacific.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">by Camille Jacobson ’19</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

In anticipation of the issue’s imminent arrival, features board members Indiana Seresin ’15, Faye Zhang ’17, Caleb Lewis ’17, and Lily Scherlis ’18, sat down with outgoing president Julian Lucas ’15, for a discussion centering on their nonfiction contributions to the magazine, and the many avatars of possession analyzed therein. Below find an abridged transcript of the first of this two-part conversation, in which Seresin’s “A Love Letter to My Stepmom,” and Scherlis’ “Their Party,” are considered. In part two, the group will discuss Lewis’ “When the Mammy Sphinx Gawks Back at You!” and Zhang’s, “Full Circle: (Exotic) Odysseys Through (Oriental) Rainforests on (Outlawed) Tour Buses.”<span id=\"more-1629\"></span></p><p><strong>Caleb Lewis:</strong> Let’s talk first about Indiana’s piece, “A Love Letter to My Stepmom.” It explores the role that possession plays in interpersonal relationships, namely how we all desire to claim and be claimed by the people who we love. After reading the piece, I came away thinking about varying degrees of ownership in relationships and how those levels of possession play roles in determining the types of relationships that we have.</p><p><strong>Indiana Seresin:</strong> Those are absolutely the types of things I was thinking people would come away from it thinking about. A big question for me is the question of ownership and the desire to possess a person in any type of relationship, and how that’s an inclination that we all seem to have, but is also one that seems to be pretty problematic. In the context of this piece, I’m very interested in patterns of possessiveness, particularly the types of claims that parents can have towards their children. Since I’ve come to college I’ve been surrounded by people who generally tend to have grown up with a different parenting style than I did, one that is quite a lot more possessive, and involves this sense of ownership, this sense that the child’s achievements are the parent’s achievements, and that the child’s failures are the parent’s failures. I feel like I have something of an outside perspective in regards to that, not only because my parents aren’t too much like that, but also because such a strong influence in my life has been my relationship with my third parent, my stepmother, who isn’t like that at all. I think that experience has served as this beautiful, complicated, alternative way of having a parent-child relationship that doesn’t necessarily involve these same patterns of possession, at least in the way that traditional parent-child relationships are played out.</p><p><strong>CL:</strong> You mentioned that the need to possess can be pretty problematic, and understandably so. I was struck by that when quoted Simone de Beauvoir in your piece. The quote essentially talks about how the in a mother-child relationship, the mother is possessed by the child and the child is possessed by the mother. I hadn’t thought about it before, but I realized that that ownership is something that particular groups of people have considered, for example radical feminists, and that many of them have encountered it as a societal ill. I’m sure we’ll come back to that.</p><p>But let’s switch to Lily’s piece “Their Party,” which was, I think, a bit of a psychological exploration of the Haitian practice of vodou. You touched a lot upon why the idea of spiritual possession is off-putting to many westerners. Could you talk about that?</p><p><strong>Lily Scherlis:</strong> I initially went into writing the piece thinking that I would take vodou and place it into a western perspective. What I learned very quickly is that there is no good way to do that. If we could do that easily, we wouldn’t have any trouble with the concept of possession. So I ended up flipping the entire concept on its head and interrogating the western perspective from a vodou standpoint, so it became less of a psychological exploration and more of an exploration of what even is “psychology”, why do we have all these structures for analyzing the world around us, and what do we miss when we use them?</p><p><strong>CL:</strong> I read your piece after Indy’s, so I was thinking quite a bit about the reciprocity of possession and how we, as western society, tend to be fine with possession that goes both ways. Perhaps the reason that vodou is so untenable to us is that there seems to be no give and take in our conception of the practice. You give, but you don’t really receive anything.</p><p><strong>LS:</strong> Could you clarify what you mean by reciprocity?</p><p><strong>CL:</strong> Sure, taking the earlier discussion as an example: in a maternal relationship there’s the mother owning the child and the child owning the mother, and that’s almost a form of societally sanctioned possession, because there’s give and take. But when you’re possessed by something that isn’t tangible, the lines blur, perhaps because you aren’t seen as receiving anything in return.</p><p><strong>LS:</strong> I think it is reciprocal, in less of a literal sense. You come away possessing these different personalities and perceptions of the world that inform your experience.</p><p><strong>Julian Lucas:</strong> In her piece, Lily has a great metaphor for a very difficult concept that I often struggle to express in my senior thesis on vodou. The deities in vodou are the loa, and they’re archetypes, they’re principles like love or war, but they’re also accumulations of generations. Lily compares this to a kind of transparency in a projector that you’d have in a classroom where every year more is added to the transparency. In the end, you take all of your ancestors and compress them into the transparency. What is reciprocal is that you’re possessed by this spirit, but you’re also taking possession of a long past, something that Lily captured very well in her piece.</p><p><strong>IS:</strong> Caleb, you used the term, “societally sanctioned,” and there’s kind of an interesting oppositional occurrence between Lily’s piece and mine. The gesture in Lily’s was that not only is vodou something that isn’t socially sanctioned, it’s completely unthinkable and unspeakable in our society. I was trying to do the opposite: suggesting that these types of relationships are disproportionately societally sanctioned. We mentioned radical feminist critique earlier. Even radical feminist critique has stopped criticizing the family since the second wave. For whatever reason the family structure has been enshrined as a safe place that people won’t touch with a critical eye.</p><p><strong>Faye Yan Zhang:</strong> Do you have any insight as to why that may be?</p><p><strong>IS:</strong> I think it happens for a variety of factors, and it’s something that I’m not going to claim to have an authority on. Sarah Ahmed has a great essay called, “Feminists Killjoys,” which talks about this phenomena, where if you’re known as a feminist, all you need to do is open your mouth and someone will start rolling their eyes in anticipation of what they perceive to be you about to bring down the mood. Feminists have had a really rough time critiquing in general, but since the family is supposed to be this source of love and joy, a source of definite good in our lives, I think it becomes especially difficult for feminists to broach that as a subject. It’s sacred for a reason, like: if we don’t have that, what do we have?</p><p><strong>JL:</strong> It’s interesting, in your piece, the one thing you leave to biological parent relationships is this sort of supernatural sense of knowing when something wrong is happening to the child. I thought that was interesting. In the process of editing, I wondered if those represented your actual views on the idea of your mother saying that she could sense when you got hurt.</p><p><strong>IS:</strong> It’s the kind of thing that I often roll my eyes at my mom for saying, but in the piece I talk about how we once got a phone call and she did know that something bad had happened. In many ways I think it’s similar to the types of questions that Lily’s piece brings up. I’m not a particularly empirically minded person, or someone who’s passionate about sticking to scientific explanations for things, but because I’m very critical of the idea that there’s any sort of superiority in biological parent-child relationships, I am resistant to that sort of “supernatural connection.” On the other hand, as Lily is saying in her piece, I don’t have an explanation for it, but that doesn’t take away from what happened.</p><p><strong>CL:</strong> In your piece, Lily, you talked about forms of “possession” that we see in our society. One that you mentioned were eating disorders, and how they can be understood, in the words of the prominent possession scholar Janice Boddy as, “pathological forms of embodied aesthetics.” Would you mind talking more about forms of “spiritual possession” that we see propagated in our society that we wouldn’t normally think of as spiritual possession?</p><p><strong>LS: </strong>The common analogy is schizophrenia, I came up against that a lot in various anthropology papers. I think that gets complicated because those sorts of things are so pathologized that they become separate entities. You can’t separate a lot of these phenomena from the context they’re in: the rules of our society mean that the actual occurrences play out differently, precisely because they are pathologized. I think that the different ways of explaining those occurrences, be it medicine, or what we would label mysticism, just show our capacity as humans to work our way through things that aren’t entirely empirical or obvious or connected to “reality.”</p><p>Read Part Two <a href=\"http://theadvocateblog.net/2015/03/24/possession-a-conversation-part-two/\" title=\"POSSESSION: A Conversation–Part Two\">here</a>.</p><p><em>Transcribed by Caleb Lewis ’17</em></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Maps that we used to rely on before we had iPhones, old faded copies of <em>National Geographic </em>and <em>Cooking Light</em>, and a couple of packs of gum that had long lost their crisp shape, were all crammed into the pocket behind the driver’s seat. Squeezed behind these obsolete artifacts was a book, lovingly crumpled from a combination of wear, and, later, of neglect.</p><p><em>882 ½ Answers to Your Questions About the Titanic</em> sustained me through most car rides, long and short, throughout early elementary school. Each section in the book was short and manageable, introducing me to facts about the steerage, and the bow and the stern every time I turned the page. Some passengers brought their dogs on board.  The kitchens were equipped with twenty-five cases of olive oil, and the three hundred cases of shelled walnuts.  Supposedly, thirteen couples traveling were on their honeymoons. Some scholars speculate it would have been safer to hit the iceberg straight on.  All eight members of the ship orchestra lost their lives. I learned that April 15—tax day—was the day the Titanic sank. Engrossed, I didn’t mind the mild nausea I felt as I read in the backseat.</p><p><span id=\"more-1428\"></span></p><p>While this was one of the few books on the <em>Titanic</em> that I actually owned, the Nautical shelf at the local library replaced ‘Children’s Books’ as my destination of choice. I did own, though, a model of the <em>Titanic</em> that could be submerged in water. When enough water filled the plastic interior, I watched with wide eyes as it would split and then sink. Afterwards, I would let the water drain, and put it back together, for next time.</p><p>Before long, I was rattling off facts about the <em>Lusitania</em>, the passenger ship that was hit by a German U-boat during World War I. On the playground, waiting in line for four-square, I explained to my friends what torpedoes were. Before turning off the light each night, I pored over pictures and skimmed captions about the <em>Andrea Doria</em>, the boat that sank in the 1950s, after colliding with another cruise liner. I still remember thinking how peculiar it was that this ship didn’t sink as dramatically as the Titanic did with its stern sticking up into the night sky. Instead, it sank “horizontally,” rolling over into the depths of the sea.</p><p>2012 marked the hundred-year anniversary of the famous ship’s sinking, which gave those fascinated by the Titanic reason to celebrate.The eponymous movie was also re-released, this time in 3-D, and the love story between Jack and Rose captivated another generation of young adults.</p><p>In theaters, the story, loss, and romance eclipsed the number of workers that built the ship in Belfast, or the fact that the hull of the Titanic of eight hundred and eighty-two and a half feet long, or that only 214 of the <em>Titanic’s</em> 899 crew members survived. The film created its own spectacle, separate from the ship’s historic hype and subsequent tragic voyage. Its fourteen Oscar nominations and haul of eleven of Academy Awards, and budget of $200 million, its star-studded cast of DiCaprio and Winslet shined the brightest. Apparently besides directing, James Cameron himself actually drew all of Jack Dawson’s sketches. The filming largely took place in Baja California, Mexico. The film became the first ever to gross over $1 billion. Triumphant cries of “I’m king of the world,” resounded around the world.</p><p>In the ensuing flurry of media coverage, it became clear that many had failed to realize the connection between the re-release and the anniversary. In candid public tweets, thousands admitted to not realizing that the <em>Titanic</em> was a ship that actually sailed and sank. For them, the <em>Titanic</em> simply was a high-grossing romantic movie and the inspiration for an iconic two-person pose.</p><p>If one casts the right actors and actresses, a fantasy and story will serve as a popular placeholder. The facts on which Hollywood’s unabashed adaptation was based had sunk out of sight, as the real-life tragedy continued to sit solemnly on the ocean floor.</p><p>But the historical event had its own set of facts and figures, in which I took comfort as a child. My favorite book, aptly titled <em>882 ½ <strong>Answers</strong> to Your Questions About the Titanic</em>, seemed to play into this frenzy of information the most. Regardless of how many questions the young reader had, the book always had more answers. The rolodex of information never stopped turning. When we ate dinner, I would remind everyone around the table how much butter was on board the Titanic. I started precociously referring to inanimate objects as “she” or “her.”</p><p>Like the amount of butter, or the maximum speed of these cruise liners, I also could recall with perfect clarity the number of those who perished at sea. These figures became no more than trivia. As an eight year old with soft, flushed cheeks and slipped-on Merrells, I could rattle off the estimated range of those who froze to death, of those who died from complications related to the impact itself. I delivered these facts with a proud smirk.</p><p>As with most obsessions that swell, my fascination and fervor soon waned. I moved on to a new series of phases, diving head first into long division and the gruesome tradition of Roman gladiators fights.</p><p>I still remember that many gladiator helmets were made of bronze.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

He walks up the footbridge, down the footbridge. Then another. He turns right, right again. The city is gold. He crosses under the promenade, climbs into the blue clocktower. Hands approach, numbers rise directly overhead, chimes sound their intervals, the stone lion holds the stone book. I change directions, no light on either side of me, open one door, enter the room covered with maps, hear the mapmaker starting to speak. <span id=\"more-553\"></span>While she shows her watercolored parchment, fastens her hair, I leave, walk in conjoining squares, turning corners, continually rearriving. Venice is repetition. Street names loom undisturbed in canals. The way here is already written. My mind latches onto invisible vectors. Meaning rises somewhere above the thoughtmap. Following these right steps, I can prove anything.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The Canal</i></p><p>The sky all geometry. Triangle of steeple, thought, star. The line from the moon to my eye. Web of invisible connectives between sky and canal. The air bristling with them, <i>vaporetto</i> slicing their touch.

According to the information about contributors for the issue, the author, Alice Weil, was “a junior in the writing option.”</p><p>Weil’s prose piece traces exchanges of flowers through two phases of the narrator’s life, both before and during college. When Rachel finds herself in Cambridge, she meets Jeff. Jeff at the time “didn’t have a beard, but he was still tall and imposing in the style that strikes you either as alluring or ridiculous.” Jeff and Rachel share a night together, but fail to fully define their relationship. On her twentieth birthday of that year, she receives three gifts from three friends: a heather plant, a forsythia branch, and a bouquet of daisies and jonquils. As she leaves her teenage years behind, she seems to achieve a hat trick of gifts and “scores” three times. Yet, as the story comes to a close, Rachel looks at the note Jeff attached to the bouquet and realizes that he signed off with a sterile “—” rather than “Love.”</p><p>Poor Rachel.</p><p><span id=\"more-1200\"></span></p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/img_5583.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"IMG_5583\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1202\" height=\"714\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/img_5583.jpg?w=536&amp;h=714\" width=\"536\"/></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/img_5590.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"IMG_5590\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1203\" height=\"714\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/img_5590.jpg?w=536&amp;h=714\" width=\"536\"/></a></p><p>In my family, we don’t really give birthday presents. My parents have encouraged my brother and me to spontaneously buy and give small mementos when the moment presents itself. Recently, I received a package from home, even though my birthday is not until late June. Enclosed was a pair of striped wool socks and note from my mom, telling me that when she saw the socks, she thought of me. She signed off with a warm, scrawled, “Love, Mama.”</p><p>The socks are wearing well and still keep my feet warm.

Below, read the first part of the conversation between Indiana Seresin ’15  and Liza Batkin ’15, in which they <em>discuss Indiana’s nonfiction essay in the TRIAL issue, <a href=\"http://www.theharvardadvocate.com/content/against-new-feminism\">“Against New Feminism</a></em><a href=\"http://www.theharvardadvocate.com/content/against-new-feminism\">.”</a> </em></p><p><span id=\"more-1386\"></span></p><p><strong>Liza Batkin: </strong>You refer in your essay to Zambreno’s disdain for “wifing,” and her assumption that, as you put it, “to wife is to lose.” I found your criticism of this assumption really compelling, and hoped that we could expand upon it. In particular I wonder what, in Zambreno’s view, defines the identity of the “wife” and the action of “wifing,” and how she understands the relationship between the wife’s socio-economic position, as the domestic laborer of the household, and her more socio-cultural role, as living in the shadow and service of her “genius” husband.</p><p><strong>Indiana Seresin: </strong>Well I think what you’ve pointed out is that Zambreno is juggling two different conceptions of “wife,” without clearly differentiating between them. The first is produced through discussion of the lives of artists, writers, significant cultural figures… “great men.” This is the idea that being the wife of a genius involves suspending your own creative work in order to facilitate theirs. Figures like Solphia Tolstaya, Tolstoy’s wife, come to mind. I read that she was the copyist for <em>War and Peace</em>–she copied out the entire manuscript seven times.</p><p>Anyway, this kind of wife is separated from the domestic drudgery associated with the other kind of wifedom. It is unlikely that Zelda Fitzgerald did much cleaning, and she would have had help raising their daughter. I read a description of this kind of cultural wife–I don’t know if that’s the right phrase, maybe “bourgeois wife” is better–in Hilton Als’ <em>White Girls</em>, in the first essay, “Tristes Tropiques.” Als is describing a friend who he refers to as SL, standing for Sir/Lady, who is black and male, and who falls in with a crowd of New York feminists in the 1970s. The quote is “SL became a wife, supporting a number of friends’ and lovers’ work while his own work took a backseat.” What I really like about the way Als uses this concept of “wife” is that he destabilizes it from being determined by sexuality and gender. It seems often that Zambreno is making this essentialist argument that because she is literally a wife/woman she is also the cultural “wife,” even though her husband, John, often seems to perform the wife role at least as much, if not more than she does.</p><p>This is something quite common to second wave feminism–the idea that because you are woman, you are automatically subjugated in some essential way. Whereas people writing feminist theory now, and writers like Als, refute that kind of thinking. In Als’ essay, S/L is a black man who becomes the wife to a group of assumedly white lesbian feminists.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>It’s almost as though Zambreno is conflating “wifing” the husband with “midwifing” the husband’s creative work.</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, definitely. The issue of domestic/caring labour is actually very distinct from the cultural wife question, though Zambreno keeps them intertwined. Domestic labor is probably the most devalued category of work there is–maybe apart from sex work. I don’t think that people are ready to believe that the most important work done in this country is done primarily by poor women of color who are often immigrants.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>(Who are hired by the white, rich, successful “have it all” women who are happily reading Lean In and shattering the glass ceiling).</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, yes exactly. And not just the Sheryl Sandbergs of the world–that same line of thinking is in Heroines, is in that interview with Mary Gaitskill that I quote. It’s everywhere.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Part of the reason I bring up Sheryl Sandberg is that I went to this panel last night, called “New Directions in Feminism”; one of the panelists, Mikki Kendall, a black feminist with a large Twitter presence, was particularly critical, and rightly so, of Sheryl Sandberg’s breed of feminism. Sheryl Sandberg’s feminist agenda is to create more female billionaires. But, as you say, in order to work the hours that Sandberg works at Facebook probably requires extra help around the house, probably done by women, and probably by women of color. Kendall’s point was that the people who are harmed most by the oppressive, patriarchal structures that feminists are fighting against, are those who do not have a voice in the media; are not those who are left out of the boardroom, but those who are struggling to meet the most basic needs for themselves and their families, who can’t afford child support, who are legally compelled to raise a child they didn’t plan to have, etc. What we need, in Kendall’s (and my) view is to build from the bottom up, instead of relying upon a quasi-neoliberal hope in “trickle-down feminism.”</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, exactly. And not as some kind of favor or deliberate political correctness– but to find the solutions. Zambreno argues that, as a married female artist, she is in some kind of trap. Either she or John has to be the wife–either way that’s not fair. But when you take the time to listen to/read what non-dominant–queer, Third World, women of color–feminists have to say about this topic, you’ll see that this isn’t really a trap at all, or it doesn’t have to be.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>I think we’ve sort of been circling around the second question we were going to discuss, which concerned Zambreno’s targeting of the modernist husbands for their wives’ oppression.</p><p>I’m kind of interested in jumping to the question of internet girl writing, and new feminism, if you’re game?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>It’s probably a flaw in my essay that I’m so dismissive of that genre, and call for things like “boundaries of quality,” given what we were just talking about–feminism that exists in the margins of dominant culture, that blossoms on the internet. Maybe I should start by saying that I’m actually quite critical of a lot of internet feminism too. The most alarming trend, to me, is how the relationship between online feminist theorizing and social capital allows for “calling out” to become a kind of currency. As flawed as that Michelle Goldberg piece is, this is something she picks up on. It’s treated better in an essay on the website on <a href=\"http://feministing.com/2013/12/20/on-cynicism-calling-out-and-creating-movements-that-dont-leave-our-people-behind/\">Feministing</a>.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Yeah, in last night’s panel, though, Amber Frost, another online feminist, was trying to defend internet feminism by pointing out that the problems Michelle Goldberg was picking up on are simply inherent to radical politics, activism, organizing, and not to feminism necessarily— and it may be that the splintering and “calling out” that would happen anyway in any radical political context is just more condensed and apparent in an online domain like Twitter?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>In my opinion “calling out” isn’t so much the issue… it’s the kind of popularity/social currency dimensions of that practice. It becomes posturing, showing off, narcissistic and/or cliquey… I mean these things are bad in themselves, obviously, but the bigger problem to me is that it’s so reductive.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Reductive and besides the point— the fruits of internet battles are, as you say, “followers” and caché; reaping these rewards distracts from the real fruits of the real battles that we should be fighting….</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, exactly. Anyway, so that’s my biggest gripe with internet feminism. I have a different issue with Zambreno’s internet girl writing.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Right, I was just going to ask about that. Because it seems like her internet girl writing actually has little to nothing to do with the kind of internet feminism that Goldberg is targeting… Or am I wrong?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, very little. Kind of bizarrely so.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>I was reading this great article by Emily Cooke, a senior editor at TNI, called The Semiautobiographers (<a href=\"http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/the-semiautobiographers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/the-semiautobiographers/</a>), and it begins with a mention of Zambreno’s interest in bulimic blogging…</p><p>“In the first post on her blog, Zambreno said that she was inspired by Dodie Bellamy’s Barf Manifesto (2008). Bellamy had decried the “oppressiveness” of the neatly constructed essay, lodging an appeal for chaotic, disorderly writing….And so, with Bellamy… as her disheveled [model], Zambreno “wrote and wrote and wrote and read and read and read and vomited it all up.”</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>I am not against that idea per se, though I am against the use of bulimia-as-metaphor, as I say in my essay. But I wish Zambreno (I guess Dodie Bellamy too) would interrogate more why that idea is tempting. Because my first thought is like, duh, of course that mode of writing is appealing. It’s easy. You can call the guidelines of structuring nonfiction essays masculine or patriarchal, but what about other kinds of structure? Emily Cooke talks about Allison Bechdel’s new, different, definitely non-patriarchal use of structure. It’s deliberate and complicated… not like vomiting at all.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>There’s also something tricky about the analogy that Bellamy makes between the “oppressiveness” of the neatly constructed essay and the “masculinity” of the same— to equate structure and form with masculinity is just to reify misogynist dialogues regarding the “nature” of women, their writing, their minds…</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yeah, totally.</p><p> </p><p><em>Illustration by Michelle Long ’16</em></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

		"body" : "<p>That was a winter of fire alarms. Smoke set off the blare one afternoon in mid-February, shrieks bouncing through the halls of my small-town high school as we exited, half-costumed, onto the frozen grass. Our science-teacher-cum-set-designer had decided that burning bamboo poles for our South Pacific set was a good idea. The strobes flashing from the walls when the warning system smelled smoke told him otherwise.</p><p>Something in my father’s heart wasn’t working right. Until that afternoon, we didn’t know it. Even when my mother tried to call me six or seven times to tell me about the ambulance, that tests had found something serious and they were rushing him to the hospital, the fire alarm swallowed up my ringtone’s harsh jangle. I didn’t see the missed calls until after the belching red trucks had pulled away.</p><p><span id=\"more-411\"></span></p><p>Anyway, I had other things to worry about: my best friend was dating the boy I had liked for all of high school. He was in the pit and she was in the chorus, and they spent the whole afternoon kissing in front of everybody. I was restless hot.</p><p>Musical season did that to me. It had a way of making me push at the boundaries of my small life like they were damp bed sheets twisted around me. The year before I’d played Lola, the sexy part in Damn Yankees, and paced down the hallways for hours trying to make my hips smolder as I walked. I’d performed a strip tease as part of the choreography, sliding gaudy tulle to reveal translucent black tights, booty shorts, a corset. It had been obscenely uncomfortable for my friends’ fathers, and I’d thought the whole thing delicious.</p><p>Opening night sparked several reckonings. My director was called to the principal’s office and my father called the director and the director called me. My father asked why the director always cast me as a hoochie. The principal threatened the director’s job. The director told me to keep my clothes on.</p><p>Apparently the principal had noticed me walking the hallways with a bit too much swing in my hips. It looks like she’s been having sex, the principal said. This concern about my fractured chastity made sense in a place where, rumor had it, the superintendent didn’t accept Muslim exchange students for fear they’d have to pray in the halls. I figured it wouldn’t help to tell my principal that I had read <i>Our Bodies, Ourselves</i> from cover to cover, dog-earing chapters entitled “Masturbation” and “Lovemaking with a Woman,” and had learned that virginity was a construct.</p><p>Everybody’s worries were allayed senior year, then, when <i>South Pacific</i> came around and I was cast as the eccentric old lady. That’s how I was dressed when the fire alarm went off during the third to last dress rehearsal, sending us actors shuffling to wait on the cold pavement, lighting quick cigarettes and wiping wet eyeliner, until the bulge-bellied men gave the all-clear. It was only then that I thought to check my phone. I had twelve messages.</p><p>Daddy was in the hospital. The only reasonable response I could muster was to cook chicken parmesan. I had never made it before, but knew to pound the frozen meat against the counter to thaw it, rubbing it in slimy egg yolk and cooking it in the oven until it was still pink at the bone. My sister ate it crying, the clenched flesh thick, the sauce-laden breading gloppy under her fork. Beneath white layers the muscle was the color of an aorta. Daddy was in the hospital. He had needed to be helicoptered to an even better hospital for surgery. My sister cried over the chicken.</p><p>He came home diminished and dizzy, a scar on his hip. He was boozy from anesthetic. He laughed a raspy laugh. For the next couple days, he enjoyed recounting what things looked like from the inside of the ambulance, the beeping monitors, the placebo white. I had never really thought he’d die—not beyond the first moments of checking those messages, when the very air shivered with dread—but there was something scarily tenuous to the thought of all that rubber going through him. When we talked, as I got ready for school the day of opening night, I heard his voice, its pump of breath and tissue, with a new cast of awe. As we drove past the lower school on our commute that morning, the small building shrieked with the sound of a fire alarm.</p><p>At the cast party a couple of days later, we seniors got wine-heavy and played spin the bottle with wet lips, tongues loose and hungry. For a moment I felt like Lola again, tipsy, a rip in my stockings. The play had gone off without errant stripteases or burnt bamboo accents, and my father had promised to begin going to the gym every day. That night, as the rest of us messily kissed over the sticky coffee table, my best friend and the boy I liked knit their limbs together in the other room. That kind of heart trauma still seemed the most important.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

He left the theater outraged. The version of <i>Shrek</i> that he saw had been dubbed in France and then imported to Quebec, something that rendered it incomprehensible to his and apparently many other children. The dub, it seemed, had been infected with Parisian slang and garbled by an unfamiliar accent, unpleasantly distinguishing it from the international French Quebecers have come to expect in films and television. At the center of a media frenzy, Dumont called for a radical solution. He proposed a bill that would “require all movies distributed in Quebec to be dubbed in Quebec, or not shown at all.”¹ </span><span class=\"s1\" style=\"background-color: initial; font-size: 14px;\">This bill did not pass.</span><br></p><p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align:left;\"><span id=\"more-1706\"></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> One explanation for this proposal is that expanding the dubbing industry means expanding employment opportunities for Quebecers. Yet imagined profit can only account for so much of Dumot’s fervor and public response to him. Take a look at the practice of dubbing more globally. Consider, for a moment, some countries in which dubbing is the norm: Spain, Italy, and Germany. These countries all have large enough consumer bases to make dubbing, an expensive process, profitable. Yet profit does not explain why Catalonia, an autonomous community in Northeast Spain with a population slightly lower than that of New York City, regularly produces dubs in Catalan, a language spoken in the region, when 99% of its inhabitants could understand dubs in Castilian Spanish. (The government actually loses money yearly doing this.) It also does not explain why countries accustomed to dubs continue to prefer dubs while those accustomed to subtitles continue to prefer subtitles. Addressing this question, a 1991 translation studies article points out that the economic and political histories of dubbing countries may be the actual source of their practices.</span><span class=\"s1\"> For the fascist governments that in the twentieth century variously controlled Italy, Germany, and Spain, having a single standardized language was a method of mass control and a point of national unity. In Spain, Franco attempted to eradicate minority languages. In Mussolini’s Italy, non-dubbed films were prohibited. Foreign (especially American) influences in media were strategically rejected for the sake of national unity. Dubbing became a propagandic way to repel outside culture while affirming the symbolic power of the national language.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Today, while no longer reeking of oppressive centralization and Fascism, nationalism and cultural protection continue to be compelling explanations for the quantity and diversity of dubs. A 2010 article on the situation in Quebec by Luise von Flotow, a specialist in problems of translation, reports that the labor union <i>Union des artistes </i>(UDA),</span></p><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">wants to take control of both the language and timing of foreign films. There is nothing more ridiculous, they say, than to have North American realities interpreted for Québecers by expressions and accents from Paris…The debates around dubbing are thus in line with recent initiatives to protect cultural diversity in the francophone world, and which target the power and influence of globalized English-language products.²</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Elsewhere Von Flotow remarks that “when the UDA website asserts that “<i>on veut s’entendre</i>” [we want to hear ourselves], it means that ‘we’ do not want to hear English, and therefore subtitles are out of the question, and ‘we’ do not want to hear a French we do not speak either, a foreign version of our language.” ³ </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Unified language is of paramount concern to many countries and communities, especially as they try to stall the unrelenting influence of American media on their culture. Minority languages are no longer the menace, the homogenizing power of American media is. In Franco’s Spain, Catalan was banned. Now, in 2014, the Catalonian government has again modified its law on film dubbing, obligating American companies to dub 25% of their films exported to Catalonia in Catalan or face a fine. Controversy erupted. As always, the Catalan government reminded critics that Catalan is a co-official language with Spanish in the community of Catalonia. It has the right to be promoted too, doesn’t it?</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> It’s not hard to see that Catalonia and Quebec’s efforts to protect their languages and Disney’s efforts to dub movies like <i>Frozen</i> in 41 languages and rely on the same principle: dubbing’s weird ability to make people feel like a movie was “made for” them. Both commercial and cultural pressures to dub reveal the total hypocrisy of any dub: it appears to facilitate connection with the culture shown in the film, while, in fact, aggressively promoting the culture of the language in which it is dubbed. This is why dubbing’s such a valuable political tool. It gives diverse cultures a voice, even if that voice is infelicitously shoved into others mouths. This is also why regional dubs are hotbeds for nationalist sentiments and international, supposedly neutral dubs are objects of deep resentment: Did the last Disney movie to bust your block give you a voice? Did it ignore the way you talk? Did it <i>distort</i> the way you talk?

His poems are created by the divine. They’re passed on by the voice of a goddess as it takes over his lungs.</p><p>The Greek epics open with an invocation. Tell me, muse, of the ingenious hero. Sing, muse, the wrath of Achilles, son of Peleus. Is it a plea or a command? But, either way, it says that inspiration comes from something else.</p><p>It comes through you, and your job is to get out of the way. You don’t lead it. You follow. So say the Greeks.</p><p><span id=\"more-954\"></span></p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">♠</p><p>I am eight and out on the wet dock.  It is new summer and my bathing suit is clingy since I have been swimming, but I am too young to mind.</p><p>I am far out over the water.</p><p>The lake is a different color here, murkier than the roped-off part by the shore. The lifeguard peers at me but then a girl stops beside him and his attention wanders. I am unwatched. There are pitched calls and laughter back behind, but they fade out.</p><p>It comes up my spine, the need. It is not there and not there and then it is, it is coming through and I have stopped everything else. My neck thumps with pulse.</p><p>I jump. When I hit I slide through the water fast and the silt rises up everywhere like blood. I can’t see  anything except the rushing.</p><p>I don’t know where the surface of the water is—I’m terrified.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">♣</p><p>When I begin to read Marx I see it differently. The poetic conceit is a myth. It’s an idea created by a class of people who want to hoard the artistic means of production: that you can’t choose to make art, it chooses you. The people who hold cultural capital don’t like pop music, spoken word, stories with morals, because those forms try too hard. Because they’re not letting the muse run through them.</p><p>This is the ideology of an artistic class: that some other power controls who can make good art.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">♥</p><p>It is the middle of April, past midnight, and I am walking toward the river. The rain keeps hitting me. I feel it in my skin. When I come to the Charles I stand by the water for a while. Then I cross the first bridge I come to.</p><p>It’s dark but lit bright at the far end, so I feel like I’m walking into some version of heaven where the rain is white. Somewhere in between I stop. The need comes again. Then my legs are dangling while I sit on the side of the bridge, watching the river come under like molten glass.</p><p>It’s a romanticized image—I want to wreck something.</p><p>A drunk guy staggers past, then another. The second one shouts, “Don’t jump, man, don’t jump.” I can’t tell if he is earnest or joking. He laughs a little, anyway.</p><p>There is a sense of vertigo. And it’s not so high, the shore is not so far, the water is deep enough here. I remember the wet dock and the absent lifeguard and the silt rushing to crowd the water. I remember the terror, realizing I was swimming downward. Trying to follow the bubbles because vision and touch and inner ear weren’t enough.</p><p>I don’t go any further. I just brace against the rain beating hard on my cheek.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">♦</p><p>There is a particular form for nonfiction. A small anecdote is invested with meaning. This formula feels wrong: I have been told that that is not what art is. That art has no direction and no such clear meaning. That you cannot know where you are going when you start.</p><p>Once I went out to the ocean with my grandfather. His boat had a spherical compass perched in the deck, white arrows against a navy background. I stared at it while we got farther from the harbor. Then we couldn’t see land. The ocean surface was dark, which meant deep water, and there was nothing else.</p><p>I kept looking at the compass, but it didn’t mean anything. My grandfather had his hand on the tiller. The orb shifted around while the boat rocked and tacked. As night came on the sphere got filled with the dark, and the symbols glowed white against it.</p><p>I didn’t sleep much that night. Most of the time I still don’t. Sometimes right before I go to bed it’s a physical weight, the fear of orientation lost. Sometimes I walk by the water and the excitement of it is a siren calling me down. And sometimes I just am it, and this is my form.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

		"body" : "<p>In Werner Herzog’s wild film <i>Aguirre: The Wrath of God</i>, which we recently screened upstairs in the Advocate, the main man Aguirre goes mad in pursuit of the fabled city of gold, El Dorado. He co-opts a royal expedition on the Amazon and presses madly on down the river, drunk on pride and the scent of immortality.</p><p>One scene brings a pair of natives to the raft; they have come to tell about a prophesy. But Aguirre sees a gold necklace on one of them, and loses his composure. <i>Where did you get that? </i>he growls with crazy eyes, Klaus Kinski eyes. <i>Where does this gold come from?</i></p><p><span id=\"more-725\"></span></p><p>Aguirre’s madness is to go on downstream when there is nothing there but death. His madness is the promise of the origin, the mirage of a city that rises up out of a necklace. He assumes there has to be a single source. On and on downstream, the raft of Aguirre. <i>I am the wrath of God</i>, the crippled Spaniard bellows at the silence. <i>Who else is with me?</i></p><div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 510px\"><a href=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7023/6710161165_2f4e4bee99.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"297\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7023/6710161165_2f4e4bee99.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Image courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.macguffinpodcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.macguffinpodcast.com</a></em></p></div><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Image courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.macguffinpodcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.macguffinpodcast.com</a></em></p><p>Herzog’s camera swings in a dizzying circle. The jungle does not move—only the raft does, and the camera. Aguirre himself is finally still. The only movement on the raft is the monkeys.</p><p>The filming of <i>Aguirre</i> was its own ordeal—think a German New Wave <i>Apocalypse Now</i>. But where Aguirre the madman fantasized of arriving at the source, Herzog’s own imaginative expedition took him only as far as the river. Both these men were megalomaniacs, in their way, but we think warmly about one of them.</p><p>A number of great rivers and shores mark this issue of the<i> Harvard Advocate</i>. Some are imagined, some are quite literal. Through the theme of <i>Origin</i>, we wanted to indulge an age-old fascination with the times and the places of beginning. It was important to us that the word not be pluralized. It would be <i>Origin</i>, not <i>Origins</i>, so that each contribution had to face the same but separate challenge: the inherited structure of a singular yearning. Each text, that is—however compliant or disruptive—would be thought of as its own expedition.</p><p>The theme is fitting in a year where we have made bold strides forward as an organization—into the digital landscape, through our new blog and updated social media presence, and also into our history, thanks to our exciting collaboration with the <a href=\"http://metalab.harvard.edu/about/\" target=\"_blank\">metaLAB@Harvard</a> and the University Archives. It has been our aim to move past the nostalgic languor of being “historical” and to start animating our history in illuminating ways. For our blog’s weekly column, members have been digging through the archives—leafing through messy piles of bound volumes in the Sanctum—and a variety of gems have come to light: the early work of <a href=\"http://theadvocateblog.net/2012/11/21/from-the-archives-wallace-stevens/\" target=\"_blank\">Wallace Stevens</a>, as expected, but also a scandalous excerpt from <a href=\"http://theadvocateblog.net/2013/02/06/from-the-archives-henry-miller/\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Miller</a>, some fascinating advertisements, and a number of poems submitted by one <a href=\"http://theadvocateblog.net/2012/11/13/from-the-archives-the-velvet-undergrounds-lou-reed/\" target=\"_blank\">Lou (here “Louis”) Reed</a>.</p><div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 510px\"><a href=\"http://www.bookofjade.com/pictures/harvardadvocatepic.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" \" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.bookofjade.com/pictures/harvardadvocatepic.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Image courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.bookofjade.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.bookofjade.com</a></em></p></div><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Image courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.bookofjade.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.bookofjade.com</a></em></p><p>The cooperative process of creating and developing <i>Notes from 21 South Street</i> has allowed us to expand the Advocate’s presence beyond our four static issues per year. We have endeavored to share online something of the wonder we find within the four walls of the Advocate house: a wonder based as much on collision as it is on intention—those chance meetings, collaborations, and discoveries of new ideas that take place outside the boards’ official mandates. The <i>Advocate</i> this year has been inspired not only by its young and energetic membership but also by the new connections we’ve forged outside the magazine, from our new allies in the digital sphere to the friends we made at our open-to-all January writers’ workshop. To all of these, our heartfelt thanks.</p><p>We hope that you enjoy the <i>Origin</i> supplements on the blog and see them, along with the rest of the work published there, as an effort to share the bustling life of the building with our readers. The historical supplement, which will be released this coming week, was designed with similar intentions.</p><p>At 21 South Street, surrounded by traces from some of America’s greatest writers, it is easy enough to think—with Umberto Eco (or with the Kinks)—that all the stories have already been told. By getting our past off the shelves and into our hands, however, we seek to make our history available for play and variation. Nostalgia has the power to lure us, like Herzog’s Aguirre, towards a false authenticity, and to leave us lethargic thereby. In the production of the <i>Origin</i> issue, our interest has been rather in the expedition itself, because it is there that we see the realest work of imagination.</p><p>Andreas Huyssen writes that remembrance, too, is a pole of utopia. With this in mind, we offer you <i>Origin</i>. After <i>Blueprint</i>, after <i>Fanfare</i>, I like to think of this issue as the long walk back after a night out—towards home, perhaps, or to wherever you end up.</p><p><i>By Alexander Wells ’13, President Emeritus</i></p><p><i>You can view the issue and subscribe to the Harvard Advocate at <a href=\"http://www.theharvardadvocate.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.theharvardadvocate.com</a>.</i></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Davis is the author of seven novels, including </i>Duplex<i>, which was published by Graywolf Press in September. You can find “The January Tunnel,” a chapter of her upcoming novel, in the Advocate’s latest issue, </i>TRIAL<i>.</i></p><p><span id=\"more-1351\"></span></p><p><i></i><strong>The <i>Advocate</i> is publishing a chapter from your next novel. What’s the general scope of the novel, and where will this chapter occur?</strong></p><p>It’s very hard to answer those questions, because the novel is still in process. I’m not writing this novel chronologically, so I am not one hundred percent sure at what point in the book “The January Tunnel” will appear. My guess is it will not be too far from the beginning, because it introduces the sense of walking on a trail of some sort, and that’s the unifying factor, at least at this point, as I know it for the book.</p><p>Last summer I walked a little portion of what most people know as the trail to Santiago de Compostela, which is in Spain. I was walking the part of the trail that runs through France. I had actually started writing the novel in which “The January Tunnel” will appear before going to France. I didn’t think that walking on the trail had anything to do with the book I was writing, but it mysteriously turned out that I had already written a number of aspects of the walk into the book. It was a little spooky. As a result, the central characters in the novel all have in common the fact that they are pilgrim walkers. Like the pilgrims in <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, all of the characters are going to be designated by profession.</p><p><strong>Let’s turn to <i>Duplex</i>, your most recent novel. While several of your novels feature fantastical elements, these often prove to be figments of a character’s imagination. In <i>Duplex</i>, however, robots literally live in the suburbs, an actual sorcerer drives around in a shiny car, and mysterious airships called scows fill the skies. What brought about this change?</strong></p><p>The world of <i>Duplex</i> is completely based on the street on which I grew up. On some level, I think it is as realistic as a description of a world can be, according to that sense of it you carry with you as your life moves on.</p><p>What I wanted to replicate was that sense of, “It is just the way it was,” the way that things are presented in a fairy tale. There’s no explanation. If there are robots living on the street, there are robots on the street, and we don’t know how they got there, or why they’re there, or even their psychological implications. They’re just there. That felt absolutely right to me and very true to my version of reality. In the same way, it seemed to me that these people who lived down the street from me, when I thought about it, <i>were </i>robots. It wasn’t that they were <i>like</i> robots, but the only really good explanation for that family was that they were robots.</p><p>That was the way I approached all the information that went into the book. It all presented itself to me in that way. You’re playing outside, it’s getting dark, it’s a summer night, and a car comes down the street. There’s something completely otherworldly about that. That was where I began.</p><p><strong>Where did you grow up, and how did you begin writing fiction?</strong></p><p>I grew up in Philadelphia, and I began writing when I was pretty young. I started out writing poetry. I actually thought I didn’t have the attention span to write something longer, although I was putting lots of things into the poems that I was told didn’t belong there. Back then the taste was for really short lyric poems. I think if I’d been older and had a stronger sense of purpose, I would have told everybody to go to hell and done what I wanted to do, but as it was I ended up taking these things out. As it happened, all the things I was taking out of the poems were precisely the sorts of things a person could put into a piece of fiction. Eventually, it dawned on me that I had always preferred reading fiction, and so I started to write short stories. I had pretty immediate amazing luck publishing a couple of my very earliest stories in <i>Esquire</i> magazine back in the days of Gordon Lish.</p><p>As I kept writing short stories, they got longer. At some point, I realized that what I really wanted to do was write a novel. The very first novel I wrote was horrible, as so many first novels are. I put my novel in a box and hid it somewhere. I don’t even know where it is anymore. When you’re working on a novel, you have this idea that it’s not easy to write one, and that one of the things you have to do is persist through the difficult times. Inevitably, there’s always that moment when you find yourself wondering, “Well, is this an instance of a problem that I have to persist through, or am I just working on a horrible novel that I should just get rid of?”</p><p>I was wondering that with my very first novel, and then one night I had a dream. At that time, I lived out in the middle of the country. In the dream, I was walking out of the house toward the barn, and this horse stuck its head out through the top of the barn door. It was Mr. Ed, the talking horse. He said to me, “It’s borrrring,” and I knew he meant my novel. From that moment on, I put my novel in a box and moved on to the project that became my actual first novel <i>Labrador</i>. That was all because of Mr. Ed.</p><p><b>The link between writing and dreaming is central to <i>Duplex</i>. In the book’s universe, duplex neighbors are able to share dreams due to the proximity of their brains. How do you consider this novel, or perhaps the novel form, as a space where minds can meld?</b></p><p>I’m very interested in the place where a work of literature makes a transition from one place, one thing, one person, one something to another—where there is an implied gap of some sort. Sometimes, this will literally appear as white space on the page. Sometimes, you’re sitting in the car with a character, and then, without any real descriptive transition, you are no longer in the car—rather, you are walking up a hillside three days later. When those kinds of transitions work, you don’t feel jolted or shocked or confused. It makes sense in some weird way that you were here and now you’re there. In between, there’s this place where I think the reader’s mind is working in concert with the writer’s mind in an incredibly strange way. The psyches join, so that the reader has access to something that hasn’t even been put into words.</p><p><b>A middle ground of some kind recurs throughout your work. Sometimes, this middle ground is spatial, like<i> </i>a duplex; sometimes, it’s metaphysical, like the title realm of your 2006 novel <i>The Thin Place</i> in which the living and dead coexist; sometimes, it’s conceptual, like the uncanny. What makes you gravitate toward these uncertain middle zones where distinctions dissolve?</b></p><p>I think I gravitate there for two reasons. One, because that is quite literally the way I experience life in the world. I have always had a very strong sense that things are not quite the way they seem to be. You can pin this easily on the fact that I grew up in a crazy household where the only way you had any hope of knowing what was going on was by reading between the lines, because nobody was actually coming right out and saying anything to explain their behavior. In that way, there’s a nice, solid psychological explanation.</p><p>I also believe that I have a predisposition in that direction. When I was pretty little, some guy from the University of Pennsylvania came to my first-grade classroom, and he was doing some project using these cards to test out extrasensory perception. So, he sat on the other side of this board, and he would hold up a card that had a shape on it, and you were supposed to say what shape he was holding up. I got a perfect score. Accordingly, I have a predisposition for all those realms where things are a little off.</p><p>When I read, I’m always drawn to literature where you don’t know exactly what’s going on. It doesn’t have to be a work of literature where something really weird or wild is happening. For instance, I love reading murder mysteries because you don’t know what’s going on. You know that something has happened, and you’re trying to figure out why or how it happened. I’m just attracted to that mood in a piece of writing. Taking the very good advice to write what you want to read, I think that’s why I write the books I write.</p><p><b>I get the impression from your novels that not only do you want to give the reader this feeling of estrangement and curiosity while reading the novel, but you also want the reader to come away with this feeling when they look back up at the real world. To what extent is this your intention?</b></p><p>In every one of the books I write, I want to create a world that the reader enters into entirely and then finds it difficult to get out of. As a reader, I remember and revisit those books that change the way I see, or the way I feel, or the way I hear. That’s what I want my books to do to readers.</p><p><em>Illustration by Michelle Long ’17</em></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Courtesy of <a href=\"www.themarkbradfordproject.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"www.themarkbradfordproject.org\">www.themarkbradfordproject.org</a></em></p><p>The Harvard Design School occupies the core of my mental campus map. Inside the efficient Bauhaus structure, I imagine, designers construct precise models for future spaces. They synthesize and restructure theories from around the university, as they fit them into physical frameworks of steel, Plexiglas, and wood.  Unlike most Harvardians, these academics make things. They belong to the real, physical world.</p><p>At first, the recent exhibit at the Design School seemed to confirm this image.  Maps on walls and in display cases rendered spatial indicators—topography or population or climate—in aesthetically pleasing visual codes. Design students’ experiments in cartography shared space with gorgeous, abstract expressionist visions. The exhibition’s title, however, is “Cartographic Grounds: Projecting the Landscape Imaginary”—despite their apparent exactness, the facts and figures portrayed by these maps are fictional.</p><p><span id=\"more-226\"></span></p><p>A course I’m currently taking, “Stranger Than Fiction” with Carrie Lambert-Beatty, examines contemporary art projects that perform fictions as if they were true, everyday events. We have examined a utopian version of <em>The</em> <i>New York Times</i> dated six months in the future; artists who have assumed alternate personas for large portions of their lives; and museums that have staged excavations of their facilities, revealing the buried artworks of invented actors. All of these projects have gained criticality, or the ability to challenge existing philosophies and social structures, through this fictional strategy. After revealing themselves to be fictions—after shaking off their cloaks carefully stitched into the fabric of the everyday—these projects force us to reevaluate conventional structures and to question our usual perceptions.</p><p>The maps at Harvard’s Design School are not as critical, or at least not in the overtly political sense. Unlike the critical fictional projects, the initial viewing experience of these maps does not seem less legitimate after the project’s “big reveal”: the maps’ subjective schemes for processing a landscape seem to speak more to our experienced interactions with the world than any factually correct graph of data might. These mappings of associated colors and walk patterns suggest the way in which memories and associations color my own interactions with a space. As I leave the exhibition, I’ll reenter campus, processing Cambridge Street with an additional lens of color, or walk pattern, or topographic layer. They also recall the invented interpretive schemes of digital technology in general: these maps are not fictions but rather technologies that inform our everyday experience. Perhaps “fiction” in contemporary art operates increasingly, then, as a function of our digitally influenced and designed environment—and not exclusively as a theoretically produced, political tool. Carrie Lambert-Beatty’s seminal essay on the strategy, “Make-Believe: Parafiction and Plausibility,” does not explicitly argue that these projects predominantly serve activist purposes. But responding theorists like Jose Falconi have suggested its primary function as a challenge to the status quo.</p><p>Artists and architectural designers (however arbitrary a distinction that may be) have increasingly overlapped in method and aim in recent years.  <i>Art Forum</i> published a roundtable in last month’s issue that discussed the architectural concerns of much contemporary art. Olafur Eliasson, for instance, has researched principles of light and physics to produce immersive, architectural environments, and Hilary Lloyd has explored the architecture of film installations[1].  Mixed media “painters” Mark Bradford and Julie Mehretu have produced their own visual languages to signify the contemporary landscape. In their vast and textured versions of regional <em>Google Earth</em> images, and in their complex arrangements of minute, geometric shapes, Mehretu and Bradford encode a contemporary landscape that is, paradoxically, local and global; abstract and representational; actual and virtual. Discussions about the architecture of museums also take place within this larger debate about the role of art today.</p><p>Digitalization has helped to generate this trend—in many ways it can be interpreted as a resurgence of the early twentieth century’s dominant philosophy on art, which saw architecture as the structuring logic of an ideal model of art production. Digitalization inevitably charges architects with artists’ traditional roles: the virtual projections of landscapes at the Design School seem more apt for building environments than any physical structure would be. To build—to ensure successful reception of their environments despite increased levels of mediation between maker and audience—architects must first produce artistic visual schemes. These maps’ visualizations of a space enhance the cognitive maps we habitually use. Though the ribbons of color and figural themes may not challenge the foundations of aesthetic experience, this is not to say that they or similar artistic-architectural works are not political, nor that they lack the potential to be. After nearly a century of confrontational interventions and abrasive shocks to aesthetic experience, maybe this digital age we live in offers new and more pleasurable possibilities for the fusion of art and life. The challenge for these artist-architects would then be to preserve these aesthetics, as they steer their art back towards the process of democratization. For now, these images steer my mental map: absorbing the topographical strata in purple and yellow hues, organizing the shifting sensations into a pattern of lines and dots.</p><div>\n<p>[1] Demand, Thomas, Hal Foster, Steven Hall, Sylvia Lavin, Hillary Lloyd, Dorit Margreiter, Hans Ulrich Olbrist, and Philippe Rahm. “Trading Spaces: A Roundtable on Art and Architecture.” Interview by Julian Rose. <i>Art Forum</i>, October 2012.</p>\n</div><p>[1] Demand, Thomas, Hal Foster, Steven Hall, Sylvia Lavin, Hillary Lloyd, Dorit Margreiter, Hans Ulrich Olbrist, and Philippe Rahm. “Trading Spaces: A Roundtable on Art and Architecture.” Interview by Julian Rose. <i>Art Forum</i>, October 2012.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Using Wilder’s screenplay, directors Curt and Robert Siodmak send viewers to the Weimar Republic’s laziest days via black-and-white silent images. Intertitles declare that the characters they are about to see—Erwin, a taxi driver; Annie, his wife and a model; Wolfgang, Erwin’s friend and wine seller; Christl the movie extra, and her best friend Brigitte, a record shop girl—are all real Berliners playing themselves. The film was shot only on successive Sundays in 1929 Berlin, so as to allow the “actors” to attend to their regular occupations during filming.</p><p><span id=\"more-1493\"></span>One Saturday, a typically busy day by Zoo Banhof, one of the busiest metro centers in the city, Wolfgang notices an idle Christl waiting for a beau who never arrives. She paces around the train station, searching for the absent boy, out of place in the bustle of commuting Berliners. This is a fact that the filmmakers emphasize by an extreme zoom-out overhead: she is the singular dot that is not moving in a linear fashion to an intended destination. Intrigued, and perhaps a little bored with his own daily demands, Wolfgang invites the stood-up girl to a nearby café. They delight themselves in the midday sun over an ice cream, and Wolfgang invites the girl to the beach the following day: she accepts, shyly. Erwin finishes his work for the week by repairing his taxi, and upon coming home, quarrels with Annie, who has spent the whole day lounging on her chaise. She wants to go to the movies that evening, while Erwin retorts that Greta Garbo will still be showing until the following Tuesday. Out of spite, the couple rips down each other’s wall of celebrity photos: men for Annie, women for Erwin. Wolfgang arrives to remind Erwin of their beach trip, and the men begin to play cards, ignoring Annie. Annie ends her fight by going to sleep. The following morning, the men plan to meet Christl and her best friend, Brigitte, leaving Annie, turned away from the camera on her side, in bed.</p><p>Sunday allows the weekday workers to attend to relationships, to pursue pleasure over monetary pursuits. By law, all shops in Berlin are closed on Sundays.  Although the idea of a day of rest originally comes from the Sabbath in the Bible, in this Weimar film, attending church is not the first thing on the mind for these young Berliners. The commercial aspects of the city shut down because no one intends to pursue consumerist pleasures, allowing employees and employers alike to attend to their personal matters as well. For the “actors,” playing themselves, at play, in this film, is their successive Sunday activity for many weeks; spectators are not quite being offered a documentary, but it’s as close to a fiction-documentary hybrid as you’ll get.</p><p>While our <em>Menschen </em>certainly prefer the shores of Nikolassee  to their weekday responsibilities, the story that unfolds is not always blissful. Jealousy and money troubles manage to permeate the fun. The only character safe from strife is Annie, the model, who leads the purest life of leisure depicted in the film—a life in which she appears to do little to nothing at all.  When the quartet returns back to the Banhof Zoo train station, many train stops, a day, and seemingly a world away from their time on the beach , the girls express their wishes to see the men the following week. While Wolfgang initially agrees to further excursions, Erwin reminds him that they have plans to watch a football game. We never know if the group will reunite again, either on or off camera. The Weimar era was coming to a close, and the filmmakers fled to Hollywood soon after to escape the encroaching clutches of the Nazi Party. Wilder would go on to create comedies, while the Siodmak brothers pursued film noir and science fiction, all safe on the shores of the States.  There was never any cinematic follow-up to the model, the mechanic, or the shop girls. To some extent, they belong to the bright Sundays of one of the brief respite Germany was afforded during the 20th century.</p><p>The four Berliners part ways to prepare for the week ahead. Words and a number flash across the screen: “4 Million People, Waiting For Next Sunday.” Would Sundays taste as sweet without a little bitterness in between bites? For the beach-goers, the Weimar Republic is a Sunday that attempts to heal from the First World War, but has no idea of the bleak weeks to come. After the onset of Nazism, Sunday would not return to Berlin for decades. Today, it is a staple of the city’s culture; an understanding, if you will, that following the hell of a week it only managed to put to bed sixty years after Wilder sent his foursome to the beach, Berlin has earned its days of rest.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

We are in Budapest. I come upon a man. He is sitting behind many rows of gleaming tall-stemmed crystal glasses. So many different heights. A garden. With his moistened fingertips, from glassrim to rim, he chimes his song. His melody attracts a crowd. Mostly foreigners who were sleeping the night away at hotels on the Danube embankment. Men and women, of uncertain age, dressed in evening clothes, looking at each other and smiling. The man behind the song? He plays his song so casually, evasively, as though no crowd were watching, or rather, perhaps, as though his nonchalance deflects attention. What he is making isn’t quite beautiful—too sprite, too high-pitched—but his offering is sent out into this night with an easy flourish.</p><p>My thought about him gives way to a fascination with the material he so effortlessly maneuvers. No mechanisms of hammers and coils, no curiously curved brass; only the transparent process of physics, only touch turning to sound. What is so oddly breakable about the scene? Imagine the explosion of sound that would erupt from the glasses were the table upturned. The light in each glass would unravel. The onlookers would disperse. The man would drop his heavy hands and search for the fleeting silences in the ruptured song.</p><p><span id=\"more-154\"></span></p><p>Earlier in the week I visited an abandoned glass factory whose fragments were immersed in silence. The garage door guarding the site faded into the run-down streetscape of Vadász utca. When I rapped on the window, an old man came to meet me in the courtyard. His teeth dirty, his hands wrinkled. I asked him if I had arrived at the Glass House. He squinted, he nodded. He unlocked the memorial room and left me alone to read about the site whose dilapidation eclipsed its fame.</p><p>Seventy-five years ago, the factory molted glass into thousands of sheets. They became the windows of the north’s industrial buildings. Then, having grown gargantuan in size, the Second World War arrived in Budapest and suffocated the factory with its chokehold, paralyzing commerce, barring the factory’s Jewish owner. Carl Lutz, Swiss diplomat, took the glass factory for headquarters—we can still see it, how from the seat of his desk, the strange benevolence blossomed. The diplomat issued thousands of international passports to rescue the Hungarian Jews. Beside circular stamps of Swiss validation, in typeface on discolored paper, the words “Gültig für Aufenthalt” gleamed. When papers were not enough, the Swiss diplomat stowed 2,000 Jewish refugees on factory grounds. Packed into chambers in the factory’s brick basement, the silent brigade of men, women, and children slept, woke, urinated, hungered, shivered, and survived.</p><p>I climb down to the cellar, where the only source of light is a window as long as a ruler. The whole space black save for the sun spearing in through the fingerswidth glass rectangle. How grateful we must have been for that patch of glass… Or perhaps it was frightening, this fragile spot where shelter’s teeming meets an outer world, brute with harsh light, sound. One bullet would have shattered glass, cut through a dozen bodies.</p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_09523.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_09523.jpg?w=768&amp;h=1024\" title=\"IMG_0952\" width=\"768\"/></a></p><p>Back outside, a robin-blue glass awning has been shattered in its frame above ground. I look through the windows of the building. I see three metal ladders, white buckets with brown stains, wires running along the ceiling. The reflections on the glass walls bend over each other: images of pipes and chains touch images of trees. I too entrust my form to the transparent walls of the facility. There I am, my image outlined onto the glass doorway, trapped inside this montage of ruin, construction, misgrowth, trees. Why do I feel generous for donating my shape to this massacre of abandonment, for enlivening the decay with my barely detectable human touch?</p><p>Weeks later, in Berlin, I am led to a monstrous cement building with uniform rows of windows. This had once been a school for girls. When the war comes, the Jewish children are marched to houses of prostitution where they spend their days servicing the battalions. I want to leave. I turn. I catch the brisk pivot of my reflection in the blackened window. My features and mannerisms are lent to this ghost-like being, some young girl with long dark hair, walking, in a delicate bending of time, to the brothel in which she will see out her fate. The encounter is no less a transaction, this one between my body and glass, glass always proving the stronger, taking my image from me, distorting its existence. Who is this unfamiliar figure I am now in its grasp?</p><p>Glass: the power to show me: the power to give me my own form: to take it back: to sketch me into circumstances that never bid me enter. I love these versions of myself, the sacrifice that’s required, the submission to laws of physics, to optical sensitivity. The act ultimately one of concession, the opportunity for light to own my body, to recreate it…</p><p>I remember once meeting a father and son who worked together in their underground studio on Morano blowing glass flowers. One would spin the metal rod with liquid glass on its end until the searing material ballooned. And then, under expert flicks of wrist, the balloon would deflate, the rim scallop, the glass blossom solidify. The finished orchids and irises filled an upstairs room with sparkling clusters. I passed through it once, looking to admire the small creations, but all I could see were ruined splinters of myself, cast out in a thousand prisms to make the garden built of crystal.</p><p>By <a href=\"http://www.stephanienewman.net\" target=\"_blank\">Stephanie Newman</a> ’13.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Two weeks ago, with my Spanish program, I was preparing to go on a two-day hike among them, in the peaks beyond the Tarma Valley. The route we chose runs ten miles up and down the first day, with a manageable return the next morning. I had never done anything like this before.</p><p>The night before, absent real knowledge, I was full of nervous eagerness. I had good reason to be nervous: although the hike would have been manageable in the Appalachians, even though I’m not in shape, this trail was above twelve thousand feet. As I had begun to learn, I don’t do very well at altitude. But we had spent the past day and a half exploring the region, thrilling to the beauty of the mountains, so I was also eager to start. I expected that the next days would be unforgettable, even more gorgeous than what we had seen, and that, if anything, this unaccustomed physical exertion would add vividness to my memories. A shooting star outside seemed to augur well for our endeavors.</p><p><span id=\"more-1004\"></span></p><p>The next morning, we drove to a valley below the first mountain slope we would ascend. The valley was flat, something more than five hundred yards across, with a little lake at the far end of it. The whole valley was full of water – I had not expected there to be so much water in the Andes. Our path took us around a series of lakes, but I had thought they would be lakes in a dry land. Instead, this valley and others were marshy. Little streams ran everywhere, and the floor of each valley was covered with pans of water just too well-established to be called mere puddles. The mood of the sky changed quickly up there; you could always see it reflected in the valley.</p><p>The Cordillera Negra looming before us, we climbed that first ascent under a gray sky. After making it to the top, we walked a long stretch within the clouds themselves. When we reached a high and unused road, a little after noon, the sun finally came out. The Cordillera Negra caught the clouds as they departed, puffy and no longer ominous in the newly-minted sunshine. The last of the lakes we saw that day, in the late afternoon, was Mamacocha, “Mother of Waters” in Quechua. There was no visible entrance or outlet to the lake, so it was absolutely still between the high gray cliffs surrounding. After that, me needing some help to do so, we climbed a steep zigzag path up to the shepherd’s house where we would spend the night.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, I was already doing badly by the time we made it to the end of the day’s first stretch, at the end of that first flat valley. This was early in our trek, less than a mile from where we had started. Contrary to my expectations that the difficulty would add savor to what I was seeing, my exhaustion argued mostly that I shouldn’t have done this without more preparation. From the plain of that first valley, the humps in the ground, five or eight feet tall, had started to look much taller. From the very first slope, which the experienced members of the group did admit was the hardest we would make that day, I started wondering if I would make it. I didn’t think I would faint, but the possibility crossed my mind more often than I would have liked. My hands started to look further away than they should have. Although water helped and I did better after making it to that top, I never stopped struggling. Putting one foot in front of the other consumed too much energy.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"> ♠</p><p>Some images are preserved in your memory forever, in all their detail, texture, and color. When I remember any of the things I saw that day, when I look at the pictures I managed to take, I feel that these images ought to be among them. They are not. While I do think I will remember the places I saw that day forever, I already see them as if they were sand etched on glass, a paler, more translucent form of memory.</p><p>I remember with utmost vividness the pain in my hands as we walked among the clouds. Earlier, I had sat down too readily on an unfriendly patch of marsh grass, which covered my hands in dozens of translucent spikes like bees’ stingers. Now I needed my hands free to balance, so I could not tuck them into my coat. I don’t remember why I refused to put on my gloves. The mist was cold, and it stung. I remember shaking with cold much later, on the last late ascent, as the temperature started to drop before nightfall. But the rainbow that once flashed below us, say, or the glorious golden light of sunset in the mountains—I already remember these more from pictures than from memory.</p><p>The friends who did it with me talk about this hike as a thing to have accomplished, how much they will remember of everything. I am glad I did it, but I am struck by how indistinct my memories are, of the vagueness of their beauty. This is no less true for the things I saw in the first mile than the things I saw in the ninth; a haze lies over everything. I got more out of it than perhaps I should have expected, given how little I could do at altitude, but aside from four or five images, it is all a beautiful blur.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"> ♣</p><p>I was surprised at how much water there was in the Andes, but clean water was still hard to find. In Peru, as in many places in the world, you shouldn’t drink the tap water. In places like the shepherd’s house where we stayed overnight, there is no tap. They call tea “water,” in the diminutive form, because water is only safe boiled. We were carrying water with us, too, but in the house I was grateful that they gave us tea.</p><p>The shepherd had a son, Renzo, who was three. I reached the house first, so I sat there clutching my hot mug, trying to warm up and to make friends with the kid. When the others arrived, our professor, who spent much of his childhood nearby, poured some water from his bottle into a ceramic bowl. He offered it to Renzo, saying that this was water—he should try it. Renzo took the bowl with cold, purified water, bigger than his head, and sipped from it. He finished that one. After tasting sparkling water, which the professor described as “like soda, but without taste,” Renzo screwed up his face and went to hide in a corner.</p><p>Renzo had never had plain, clean water before, at least not as far as he remembered. Maybe it was that I was finally warm myself and my thoughts were working again; maybe it was the way the sunlight piercing into that room caught the child in profile as he drank; maybe it was all the pent-up wonder I was too tired to direct at the landscape during the day, but at this, I was amazed.</p><p> </p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Or do you imagine other people reading them out loud?</p><p>Zoë Hitzig: My default mode is to think about a poem in my voice. But it’s also really important to have the external experience of just listening, rather than listening and reading, or listening and speaking.That’s why I record.</p><p>KH: You have to experience it as being read, so that you’re making sure that you’re pacing the reader in the way that you want it.</p><p>So more along the lines of voice—I think that in this poem, there are a couple of different modes or voices that’s going on, so can you take us through that a little bit?</p><p>ZH: I wrote this in two voices. Like I’m talking to an evil twin, and the evil twin is talking back. I think that who’s evil and who is not is confused throughout the poem.</p><p>KH: So, in lines like <i>“let go please, shadow sister, watch me swear you one wisdom tooth”—</i> then you have a ship metaphor—is there some sort of exchange going on between the two sides? What is this “Commerce” that’s going on?</p><p>ZH: I see this as a battle and bartering between two sides of the self, or a person and her shadow. Or however you might want to say it—a twin with her evil twin? All those different tropes can be imposed onto it. I liked the idea of thinking of the personal, one-to-one stuff as mapping onto the global world. That’s one of the things that I was thinking about—how the global lines of commerce and economy and shipping and mining and production and all of these big macroeconomic dances are mimicked in interpersonal relationships and persona.</p><p>The idea of a Protected Designation of Origin completely fascinates me—you can only say that your product is ouzo if it comes from a very specific region—what a funny idea.</p><p>KH: Do you want to talk about the form a little bit? I’m interested in these long lines, first of all—these lines that are mimetic, in a way—“<i>as further proof that shadows want flesh to buckle slump, stretch horizontal</i>”—there’s a sort of a drunken feel to some of it, and I would love to hear how you created that.</p><p>ZH: I played around with the form a lot, and the main feeling that I wanted to convey was the feeling of a jolty jaunt. Spiraling down a hill. I also have the wheel imagery that comes out in the end—and the gyroscope. I was thinking of how to get that sense of descending, downward motion, with something cyclic, but also not smooth at all. There are some lines that are perfectly iambic, and some that are tough and tricky to read. I definitely played around with the length of the lines—at first I wrote very short lines, which lent themselves to a faster pace. But that didn’t feel enough like an amble— it felt too out of control.</p><p>KH: Does ouzo factor into the shipping idea? The idea of an intoxicant coming from a distant place?</p><p>ZH: Yeah, there’s a lot of intoxication in this poem. One of the things I was thinking about when I was writing the poem was how bizarre it is that ouzo—and other liquors that typically use anise—look like milk when you put water in them. A glass of ouzo or a glass of absinthe on the table can be mistaken for milk?</p><p>KH: Did you ever write under the influence Zoë?</p><p>ZH: What? (laughter). I don’t think I wrote this poem while I was drinking. It was definitely inspired by intoxication and the relationship that you might have with an intoxicated self.</p><p>I was writing this poem in Greece. Interestingly two of the poems that are published in the TRIAL issue are set in the Aegean Sea.</p><p>KH: Matt Krane’s ‘For the Crew Marooned On an Island in the Aegean Sea’. <i>TRIAL</i> is going to be great.</p><p>ZH: This issue will be <i>great</i>.</p><p><em>Illustration by Michelle Long ’17</em></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

		"body" : "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"407\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/DBk1Mrb4RyM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"670\"></iframe></span></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">About twenty minutes into the recently released David Foster Wallace biopic, <i>The End of the Tour</i>, the journalist David Lipsky, played by the appropriately leptosomic Jesse Eisenberg, eagerly (that is, enviously) questions Jason Segel’s DFW about the attendant benefits of his newfound fame. “This is nice,” Wallace responds, before adding, with a cryptic lack of emphasis, “This is not real.” </span><span id=\"more-1776\"></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the years since his death, Wallace’s legacy has undergone countless metamorphoses, although the various threads of interpretation, for the most part, have remained discrete and self-contained, failing to interact with one another—and so it’s<b> </b>no wonder that a critical or popular consensus has yet to crystallize. For some, Wallace was a prophet of the internet age and the deleterious effects of hyper-connectivity. For others, he was a disillusioned wunderkind whose genius was to realize and insist that he <i>was</i> disillusioned, while simultaneously denying he was a wunderkind. Some people even sense in Wallace a much-needed codifier of the frayed strands of postmodernity, which were left dangling by the preceding generation of novelists. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And still others, marshaled by the furiously second-rate Bret Easton Ellis, think he was an overly educated hack whose sole value was in being able to craft, occasionally and as if by accident, a glistering sentence—though this camp, it’s probably important to add, seems composed entirely of lapsed Wallace acolytes, those who’d ardently extolled his virtues only a few years ago. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>The End of the Tour</i> gracefully sidesteps this welter of cross-purposed opinion, and presents a relatively fluid viewing experience that is enjoyable, most of the time. Segel is good, Eisenberg is okay; there are plenty of laughs, and the film never exactly lags. And yet, while it does a respectable job of depicting the problem of authenticity—one of Wallace’s major concerns, encapsulated by the difference between what is “nice” and what is “real”—the film nevertheless fails to embody this problem, and in so doing it becomes a neutral, nonreactive substance: mere display. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Maybe it’s unreasonable to demand that the film interact with Wallace’s work and his manifold obsessions, that it engage with and interpret the vast and irreducible corpus. But the nature of Wallace’s work—each piece of writing seems to run on a perpetual engine of reflexive thought—almost requires that any subsequent interpretative work run up against the same roadblocks. In presenting a self-contained narrative that merely vocalizes Wallace’s concerns, <i>The End of the Tour</i> becomes a sort of coda-cum-memorial that offers only a manufactured closure, the banal précis of which amounts to something like: <i>He was a good guy, with some problems. </i></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Wallace’s great subject, as should be no surprise, was the apparently unbridgeable rupture between one thought and another. For instance, he could never quite make the unbearable fact of his falsity gel with the self-imposed imperative to be sincere; How, he seemed always to be asking himself, could these two realities have emerged from the same mind? Instead of maximalizing this gap and working it up into a howling Cartesian void, however, he circumscribed it, brought it to bay with a hyperactive bricolage of nervous second-guessing and hypothesizing. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For Wallace, the gap between self-consciousness and literary activity was not an interminable morass in which the mind wallowed. Instead, it was an asymptotic antinomy in which the mind was always an atom away from touching the truth, from grasping true expression—though the joining never occurred, as if the last, crucial synapse were perpetually misfiring. Out of this inability to connect swirls the frenetic gyre of “bad” self-consciousness that marks so much of Wallace’s work—what he once described as the “toxic, paralyzing, raped-by-psychic Bedouins self-consciousness.”</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If all of this is getting a little too theoretical, I’d draw your attention to a particular scene near the end of the film. Lipsky has just finished savaging Wallace and laying bare the apparent falsity of the author’s desire to be a “regular guy”; to make up for this, he offers to treat Wallace to a fancy meal. The film then cuts to both our writers emerging from a McDonald’s, arms overloaded with cheap patties, sodas, and fries. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The transition is a little jarring, because the film’s awareness of the conflict here—in effect, it has transformed the conundrum into a silly joke—is overridden by a willingness to simultaneously explore and exploit Wallace’s nebulous persona and his slippery, ever elusive concerns. Watching <i>The End of the Tour</i>, you get the impression it would benefit from some filmic equivalent of Wallace’s famed footnotes, or his extensive use of parenthetical asides—devices that allowed Wallace to consider the problem of falsity on a multitude of wavelengths, simultaneously. As is, the film appears to present a simple binary of awareness and ignorance, when in reality Wallace’s self-consciousness was a penumbra—it was always engaged to an uncertain extent.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For Wallace, there was never a clear, continuous argument at hand that might disprove his own falsity; his second-guessing never followed fluidly from a prior assertion—and if it did, it simply became another proof of said falsity. The spectacle of David Foster Wallace was that of a man attempting to solve this problem—to circumscribe and compress it—with an ad hoc mélange of intellectual vigor and stylistic brio, and trying to do so (we had to assume, at least some of the time) <i>sincerely</i>. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We read Wallace for this madcap entropy, in order to experience a roiling cauldron of thought that struggles constantly to define itself. And even if this frantic activity strikes us as unhealthy—even if we <i>know </i>it is unhealthy, and are forced to admit, at times, that it seems more the fevered ravings of a wounded beast than the product of a first-rate mind—it is still, undeniably, alive.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After watching the film, a friend remarked to me that its portrayal of Wallace lacked the vague and indefinable “edge” that was always apparent in the author’s real-life interviews. In these interviews, Wallace was sometimes cruel, often abstract, and nearly always oblivious to his immediate surroundings—and yet, they remain compulsively watchable, because they encapsulate the evasive inscrutability we’ve come to associate with Wallace. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><br/>\nThere is little of this “edge” to be found in <i>The End of the Tour</i>. If Wallace is inscrutable here, it is not because we struggle to keep up with the thundering progress of his thought process—it’s because the film has made him into a diagnosed neurotic, unable to grasp the simplicity right under nose.</span></p><p class=\"p1\">By Bailey Trela ’16</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

		"body" : "<p>As the augurs would have it, literature is not long for this world. Phillip Roth gives the novel twenty five years; others see that as optimistic. Many are too busy reading to have time for these doomsayers, and the greatest portion of all have never cared. Nevertheless, these fears raise a question well worth asking: What would remain of a world without good books?</p><p>Tochtli is the seven-year-old narrator of <em>Down the Rabbit Hole</em>, the  debut novella by Juan Pablo Villalobos. He’d be something like Lewis Carroll’s Alice, had Alice grown up in a fortified desert compound near the Santa Teresa of Roberto Bolaño’s <em>2666</em>. For Tochtli is the son of Yolcaut, <em>narcotraficante</em>, chief of the most macho gang for eight kilometers. He plays console games, collects hats and memorizes samurai films. He finds books useless, but reads the dictionary every evening. He wants, more than anything, a liberian pygmy hippopotamus. He’s funny – he has the proverbial babe’s mouth.  Around him and above his childish understanding, his father’s bloody kingdom waxes and wanes, disgorging headless corpses and macabre enigmas. Tochtli sees all of it. “Think the worst,” says Yolcaut, “and you’ll be right.”</p><p><span id=\"more-25\"></span></p><p><em>Down the Rabbit Hole</em> is a spare, arid novel, severely circumscribed in its lexicon and the depth of its characters. Tochtli is the only real character in the book. Yolcaut is a cartoonish gangster. Mazaztin, the tutor – with his tirades about the hegemony of the gringos and his habit of living with Amerindian tribes – is a satirical figure of the Latin American radical left. The other characters – a few guards, a gardener, a cocaine-snorting gringo named Paul – are no more substantial. But this eerie flatness is rather more what makes than what breaks Villalobos’ book. For <em>Down the Rabbit Hole</em> is a fable of the world without literature, of the world made false and shallow by lack of the narrative werewithal to plumb its more difficult depths. It is superficial because it is about the struggle against superficiality, about the spectacle of inadequate expression grappling with a dark and complicated world that lies ever beyond descriptive reach.</p><p>Mario Vargas Llosa writes in <em>Why Literature?</em> that an individual who does not read, or reads little, or reads only trash, has an impediment. Such an individual – such a world – is impoverished not only in words but in thought, “for the simple reason that ideas, the concepts through which we grasp the secrets of our condition, do not exist apart from words.” Tochtli tells us he’s precocious, or at least that he is thought to be. He is proud of many things, above all, his vocabulary, which includes such words as “sordid,” “disastrous,” “pathetic,” “devastating,” and “immaculate.” But it becomes clear that Tochtli does not know many words at all; least of all the ones he would need to discuss the traumas of his youth. He has only the words he knows, and each of them begins to bear a greater share of his voice’s expressive weight. Thus we learn that both wearing hats and the guillotine are “immaculate”; that there is “sordidness” both in the growth of hair and in a lonely life; that the memory, boredom and the nation of Mexico are each “disastrous” in their way.</p><p>What is left when a certain complexity of expression ebbs away is something flatter, more enigmatic, more akin to myth. A nod to this can be found in the symbolic, Nauhatl names of the characters, the allusions to Aztec mythos and sacrifices of human flesh. Villalobos’ novella, like Llosa’s essay, suggests that a world without literature is necessarily a world of superstition and myth. Language becomes incantatory, rather than revelatory, and in doing so approaches its own senility.</p><p>Yet, in the struggle for voice caused by limitation, there is also a new birth, a tearing of language from its frame. There are many things Tochtli cannot say, it is true, but there are also many things he can say that we cannot. The revelatory power of language lives on in neologism and creative misuse: thus we learn that politicians are “people who make complicated deals,” and that orifices are “holes you make in people so their blood comes out.” What <em>Down the Rabbit Hole </em>illustrates so aptly is that language can indeed die, but that the constraints of its obsolescence are also the seeds of its rebirth.</p><p>By Julian Lucas ’15</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Now, this is a large and existentially fraught question—especially if we accept the premise of </i>Someone Else<i>—but let’s give it a crack: How and why do you see yourself in the work of some and not others?</i></p><p>John Hughes: It’s such a difficult question to answer, I think, because it’s really about what gets under your skin, isn’t it? What irritates you, what stimulates you—what gets in under there begins to take its own life within you. And it’s something I was thinking about a lot when I was writing that book <i>Someone Else</i>, and I just couldn’t get to the bottom of it, thinking: what is it about Kafka, or what is it about Chekhov, or what is it about Borges, or what is about Dostoevsky? Certainly for the Russian writers I might say it’s something to do with the romance I have as a result of my family background, but even there, there are a lot of Russian writers, you know, so why some rather than others?</p><p><span id=\"more-792\"></span></p><p>And I really don’t know, I mean, do <i>you</i> have a sense of why it is that you like some writers rather than others? For instance, with Wallace Stevens, I loved him as an undergraduate and wrote my undergraduate honors thesis on Stevens, and I think Stevens appealed to something very cerebral in me at that time—I think at that time I had a sense of myself as hopefully being someone who could write poetry in the way that Stevens wrote poetry, in the grandiose ways that young people can think about those things, because I loved Stevens’s verse and I loved his critical writings as well. I kind of fell in love with him, I think, and that’s strange because when you look at Stevens the man, he didn’t seem like a terribly interesting man outside the writing, but I think there’s something quite nice about that too, whereas if you look at Dostoevsky, the life is as rich and fascinating and bizarre as anything that’s there in the fiction. And so Stevens really appealed to me at a particular point in my life, but I find now it’s not that I don’t like Stevens as a poet, I just don’t feel the same things about him any more as I did at that time. Maybe that’s because I spent so much time writing about him that it just went a little bit stale. I did my PhD on Coleridge and I find Coleridge a little bit difficult to enjoy, now, so in a sense doing long critical study on a writer can be a kiss of death, unfortunately, though that doesn’t always happen.</p><p>At this sort of distance, now, I can see why Stevens appealed to me at that time, with his connection to Romanticism and some of the Romantic aesthetic ideas, and all of that interested me very much in an intellectual way. I think now my interests are somewhat different from that, so he doesn’t speak to me with the same force—doesn’t get under my skin in the same way he probably did thirty or so years ago—and maybe with an equivalent time period, I might be able to answer your question, but that’ll probably be a bit late for this interview, so it’s very difficult to say exactly why.</p><p>AJBW:<i> Have you always known you wanted a life in literature? Were there any major setbacks to that pursuit? I read a great story about your search for a “life in letters ” … </i></p><p>JJH: Well, what happened was when I was doing my PhD at Cambridge, not long after the beginning I became less and less interested in the scholarly work and more and more interested in writing creatively. So I spent more and more time working on things that weren’t directly related to my thesis—which is problematic when you’re supposed to be producing a PhD: it wasn’t neglected entirely but it was becoming more and more sidelined. My supervisor was very very keen on me staying on in Cambridge, so there was all this talk about finishing the PhD and then I would apply for fellowships so I could continue my time there.</p><p>What she said to me was that if all else failed, she knew some people in the postal service there, so I could always get a job as a postman in Cambridge. And so I thought it was a wonderful irony, there, that I would still be able to achieve a “life in letters” without getting a PhD.</p><p>AJBW:<i> We’ve already talked about the relationship between your reading and your writing, and a bit about the freedom you get from responding with irreverence to tradition—but let’s talk specifically about the English language and your growing up in Australia with a strong interest in Europe. What was the process like of rediscovering your roots, linguistically? Did you read these figures only in translation? I think of the quote in the preface to </i>Someone Else<i>, when the young man obsessed with Celan corners Max Brod in a Coogee Beach café: “It’s not just that I feel a stranger in my own language,” he laments. “I’m not even at home in my imagination.” What role does language play in your own imagination, especially as concerns your interest in exile and tradition?</i></p><p>JJH: I’ll approach this in a chronological, biographical way to build a response. My grandfather chose to come to Australia when he was in a displaced persons camp in Bagnoli, just outside of Naples, in 1949. He chose Australia because it was just about as far from Europe on the map as you could see: the choice was really one of “I want to get away from this mad hellhouse and I never want to come back.” And the second thing was that it was an island, so there wasn’t a sense of having these powerful voracious neighbors there.</p><p>So when he came out here, I think he had a very, very strong sense of a Year Zero when he arrived. He wanted his children to forget about Ukraine and his background altogether, to be cleansed of all this past and all this memory, and to begin as if they had been born here and grown up in this place. He forbade the language being spoken: English was the only language allowed. That was always going to be an impossibility, because the children had already had too much of Ukrainian Russian so that English would always be a second language for them, and it was always going to be a more difficult language for them to think in and speak in. So when I was growing up, when my grandfather wasn’t around, my mother and grandmother used to speak Ukrainian Russian all the time—it was never translated for me, but it was a language that I heard all the time, and when I was very young it was the only language I heard for a large part of the day, until my grandfather came home and everybody had to switch into English.</p><p>And so I grew up with one language in my head that was really just like music, because it had no semantic meaning for me—although it’s probably unfair to say it had <i>no</i> semantic meaning, because I think I gradually came to understand the meanings of many words, so I’ve found when I’ve visited over there that I can actually understand a reasonable amount, certainly more than I would have thought I’d be able to. These words stuck, or this language stuck, but it stuck as a kind of music, so I’ve grown up with the language I communicate in, which has meaning for me and in which I think, but then this other language which is like a stream that runs beneath it, which is like a kind of dark, musical language—a language almost without meaning, or a language which means like music, so it speaks to me directly, emotionally, viscerally, all these sorts of things.</p><p>I think that’s one of the reasons why, in just about everything I write, language seems to be a subject—whether or not it’s an explicit one, as it is say for instance in <i>The Remnants</i>, where translation is a key component, and where in fact the novel is set up on the premise that it’s translated from the Russian—but I’ve never really thought about this too deeply, because I’m worried that if I do I might kill the goose that lays the golden egg, in a way, I might remove whatever tension, whatever irritations are that that stimulate my imagination. In one way, I think, what I’ve really been trying to do is to make the semantic language more closely approximate to the musical language, or I suppose what I’m concerned about is the music of language, even though language is what we use to communicate. There’s something I always love that Robert Frost once wrote: he wrote about “the sound of sense,” and I think for me if something doesn’t sound right, then it’s not working.</p><p>So there’s that, and the other thing I’ve become more aware over time is that language knows much more than we do. In a sense, we’re spoken by language as much as we actually use the language, and by starting to listen to the musical qualities of language—this is something that poets get by forcing themselves into pre-existing structures like rhythms, rhyme schemes, <i>et cetera</i>: being forced to have second thoughts—you can begin to discover things that you didn’t know you knew. You learn things through the process of writing itself, and that’s really one of the key things for me, that when I sit down to write it’s hopefully to write things that I didn’t know I knew.</p><p>I think one of the real impetuses that is this dark language which is there that I don’t know, and I suppose that’s because in a way it probably takes me back to that experience of being there with my mother and grandmother, it takes me back to the origins of language itself—or certainly the origins of my language and language learning. I remember being at Cambridge in the middle ’80s, and Germaine Greer was giving a lecture, and she said that she never read things in translation. She’s never read any Thomas Mann, for instance, because she refuses to read a book in translated. And I thought, OK, maybe there’s some nobility in that desire. But I find myself thinking almost the exact opposite of that. I think that when I read in translation I’m getting two books for the price of one, that what I’m getting is what the original language has done inside of someone else, and in that process of translating one language into another, you’re actually opening new possibilities for doing things in the host language, so it’s always been for me one way of enriching the host language in this process.</p><p>So even though I might be able to understand a little bit of German, a little bit of French, a little bit of Italian, I certainly don’t know nearly enough to appreciate the value of translations—but it doesn’t really bother me because I’m not judging the quality of the translation itself, it’s more just about what it actually does in English. Maybe it’s  another sacrilege to think like this, but it’s never really been something that’s bothered me at all. In fact, it’s been something that I really enjoy. I enjoy the fact that the original text remains largely inaccessible to me in terms of its semantics again, but at the same time it still has a kind of music for me, but because it’s a language that doesn’t mean, and I find that a really exciting experience rather than one that causes anxiety for me.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

		"body" : "<p>Tired-looking women in sleek ponytails and dirty polo shirts wipe a speckled counter, elbows rigid and rags dry. The camera focuses on bright frosting in swirls—up close, constellation-like—Cinnabons spinning on silver trays. In the background, 1940’s-style swing music plays.</p><p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"407\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/l1xIGfVFb-U?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"670\"></iframe></span></p><p>The whole scene runs in black-and-white, but it’s not a flashback. It’s a flash-forward, a glimpse of Saul’s fall and a reference to the <i>Breaking Bad </i>quip: “If I’m lucky, best case scenario, I’m managing a Cinnabon in Omaha.”</p><p><span id=\"more-1699\"></span></p><p>The scene targeted the pulsing pleasure-center of every television addict’s brain. For some critics wary of the spin-off tendency to thrive on crass, easy references, it raised eyebrows and lowered pens. Since we already know the fate of Saul (nee Jimmy McGill)—how the Cinnabon crumbles, so to speak—the prequel could only provide “cheap hits of fanservice.”</p><p>“I want to see what happens to Jimmy McGill,” wrote Eric Thurm in an otherwise positive review for <i>The Verge. </i>“I just wish I didn’t already know.”</p><p>Yet, six episodes later, we’re still watching. That’s partly because the fanservice appeals to parts of the brain outside the pleasure-center. Characters plucked from <i>Breaking Bad, </i>like the fixer Mike Armantrout and the drug lord Tuco, gain new depth on the series. The Cinnabon joke might have been a cheap hit, but Mike’s tragic backstory is Walter White grade crystal—almost 100% pure.</p><p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"407\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/_XJtabwewV4?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"670\"></iframe></span></p><p>It’s also because the show’s not really about what happens to Jimmy McGill. Cinnabon-serving aside, he has only so many options, anyway. He can succeed at the cost of his soul, or he can fail at the cost of his sanity. Howard Hamlin, the pastel-wearing powerhouse who speaks in a vernacular of sarcastic clichés—“Sometimes in our line of work you forget to listen to your heart”—represents the first option. Chuck McGill, Jimmy’s mentally ill brother and Hamlin’s one-time partner, who hides under a space blanket when confronted with electromagnetism or corruption, represents the second.</p><p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"407\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xoLXy4lRr5I?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"670\"></iframe></span></p><p>In <i>Breaking Bad, </i>Peter Gould gave us the rise-and-fall, the Shakespearean arc, the tragic hero. He also gave us the self-made man: Walter White-cum-Heisenberg, like Jimmy Gatz-cum-Jay Gatsby, lived the American Dream of self-invention, suave headwear and all. Like most American Dream narratives, it ended in a nightmare. The self-made man self-destructed.</p><p>Jimmy McGill, though, cannot really rise and fall, because he’s not a self-made man: he’s a spin-off.  In Episode Three, “Hero,” Hamlin takes Jimmy to court for copying the Hamlin & McGill logo—and even Hamlin’s outfit– on a billboard. Earlier, we watch Jimmy walk into a store, bypassing the orange dress shirts he wears on <i>Breaking Bad </i>for Hamlin’s signature blue (“Hamlindigo”). Hamlin easily convinces the judge to charge Jimmy with copyright infringement, but he can’t stop Jimmy from using his name on the billboard.</p><p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"407\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/yH05045VhmM?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"670\"></iframe></span></p><p>It’s a meta scene—a subtle jab at critics who initially charged the show with copyright infringement. As we cheer on this Robin-Hood-esque theft, we celebrate the spin-off, not the genius of self-invention but the cleverness of reinvention.</p><p>Jimmy, like <i>Better Call Saul </i>itself, molds himself with the words and images of others. In a conference-room argument with Hamlin, Jimmy shouts, hands up, “You will atone!” quoting <i>The Network. </i>After convincing a corrupt local politician to pay him a “retainer” of dirty money, Saul mutters, “Upon this rock, I will build my church.” Jimmy’s no Puritan; he’s a conman, and his best con is the copy-con.</p><p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"407\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/bi5UDdX93VE?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"670\"></iframe></span></p><p>Cheap hits of fanservice? Preparing to specialize in elder care law, Jimmy watches <i>Matlock, </i>legal pad in hand; the next day, he arrives at a senior home in Andy Griffith’s signature white suit. <i>Better Call Saul </i>does not only spin off of <i>Breaking Bad, </i>it spins off of the entire television canon. Jimmy succeeds because he has mastered the art of reference; instead of inventing himself, he tinkers around with others’ inventions.</p><p>Watching <i>Breaking Bad, </i>white-knuckled viewers asked, “can he do it”? Can Walt use an electromagnet to rob a police safe? Can he siphon off chemicals from a train? Can he rig an old man’s wheelchair with a bomb? As the show went on, “can he do it”? became “would he do it?” Would he let a woman die? Would he poison a child? Would he kill without remorse?</p><p>On <i>Better Call Saul</i>, the stakes often seem lower, the schemes a touch less theatrical. Jimmy does have a few tricks up his Hamlindigo blue sleeve—in one scene, he tricks a woman into revealing her cash-stash by planting a separate pile of money, sprayed with fluorescent liquid, in her living room. Yet, his successes tend to be tempered: he gives the woman up to a rival law firm. And he never has to kill. So, we don’t ask “can he?” or “would he?” We just ask, “how”?</p><p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"407\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/yjgrmKY34SM?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"670\"></iframe></span></p><p>When a con-gone-wrong lands Jimmy and two teenagers in the hands of a budding drug lord, there’s no dramatic rescue scene. But Jimmy convinces the meth-dealer to break the teenagers’ legs instead of killing them. When the kids complain, Jimmy objects, “I just talked you down from a death sentence to six months probation—I’m the best lawyer ever!” Later, Jimmy talks down another dealer: “I just want to open a dialogue.” While <i>Breaking Bad, </i>dealt in action, physical and moral, <i>Better Call Saul </i>deals in talk. It matters less what Jimmy does than how he presents it. That’s why the particular arc of his rise and fall—cons to cinnabons—does not matter. Whether he succeeds or fails at any given moment, it’ll just open a dialogue.</p><p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"407\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ob9QOxocDnM?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"670\"></iframe></span></p><p>The idea for <i>Better Call Saul </i>came out of a writer’s room joke. When the creators of <i>Breaking Bad </i>thought of a line or a scene too silly for the epic drama, they would say “save it for the Saul Goodman show.” If <i>Breaking Bad—</i>whose 2008 premier coincided with the start of the Great Recession—appealed to audiences discovering that the American Dream had failed, <i>Better Call Saul </i>appeals to audiences who can narrate its collapse in their dreams. We’ve seen the ending—the Cinnabons at the end of the tunnel—and we can only hope the climb (or the fall) will be interesting.</p><p>We do have two American Dreamers on the show—Jimmy’s naïve clients. One plasters his walls with mountain lion and zebra heads, and asks Jimmy to help him secede from the United States in order to escape “the fly-swatting government.” In what might be the show’s funniest scene, a man invents a weirdly sexual talking toilet, and thinks he’ll make it big. These characters are absurdist parodies of Walter White, “inventors” seeking repute, money, and independence.</p><p>Jimmy knows better. Standing in front of his copied billboard, he looks straight at the camera (he’s hired the crew of a college news station). “Like most Americans, I’m a self-made man,” Jimmy says slyly. “I’ve also had a dream, a dream that many of us have had, to own my business.”</p><p>Jimmy’s a spin-off and the billboard’s a rip-off, but the joke’s on us. These are the best cheap hits around.</p><p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"407\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/twngICc-1kY?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"670\"></iframe></span></p>",

Luckily, in his contributor’s note, he tersely reassures us that yes, “Louis Reed…formerly of the Velvet Underground, writes poetry now.”</p><p>The finality of that description belies the twenty-four solo albums, forty years of performance, and reversion to “Lou” that Reed will undergo in the decades following this publication. But this issue of the Advocate seems to have caught him in a unique transitional moment between career phases, recuperating in his parents’ Long Island home, producing work that combines past and future song lyrics with free verse.</p><p><span id=\"more-270\"></span></p><p>Lou Reed was born in Brooklyn in 1942 and raised in Freeport, Long Island, where he was once prescribed electroshock therapy for homosexual behavior. He attended Syracuse from 1960-1964, during which he studied with the poet Delmore Schwartz, who would become a friend and lifelong inspiration. After several unsuccessful New York garage band stints, Reed finally put together the <a href=\"http://us.myspace.com/velvetunderground1969\" target=\"_blank\">Velvet Underground</a> in November of 1965, serving as lead singer and songwriter. As the band’s stardom rose, it was co-opted, along with the other worthy musicians of 1965 New York, into the galaxy of Andy Warhol. Under the direction of the artist’s Factory studio, the Velvet Underground toured the country with Warhol’s roadshow the <i>Exploding Plastic Inevitable</i> and recorded their legendary 1967 debut with German singer Nico.</p><p>But after making four albums in four years, and after losing both Warhol and Nico, Reed “retired” from the band in 1970. In his parents’ home, he recovered from the disillusionment of the commercial music market and began to reinvent himself as a poet.</p><p>Reed published eight pieces in <i>The Harvard Advocate</i>, two of which are Velvet Underground lyrics. The song “Candy Says,” the opening track on the band’s self-titled 1969 album and a melancholy tribute to Factory girl Candy Darling, reappears in the Advocate in poem form. The case of Reed’s poem “The Coach and Glory of Love” is more interesting. With its prominent refrain, the poem seems to be a musical lyric as well—though, puzzlingly, not to any Velvet Underground song as of 1971. The words, in fact, turn up on an album only in 1975, when they’re slightly reworked as lyrics for the title track of Reed’s solo effort <i>Coney Island Baby</i>. Here we have a rare insight into Reed’s creative process, the opportunity to see how the poet-songwriter conceives of poetry versus song. We can ask ourselves: If “Coney Island Baby” was at least four years in the making, how long did his other songs ferment in his mind before reaching our ears?</p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/pg3.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/pg3.jpg?w=649&amp;h=1024\" title=\"pg3\" width=\"649\"/></a></p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/pg2.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-276\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/pg2.jpg?w=666&amp;h=1024\" title=\"pg2\" width=\"666\"/></a></p><p>Even Reed’s poems that did not transform into songs are, as a group, good poems—not just good poems by a rock star, but poems that have aged well, that still feel genuine and fresh. They are clearly work of a poet just getting into his skin, an explanation for Reed’s overlaps with songwriting, his slight over-reliance on erotica, and his hesitance toward abstraction. Some of his later poems are more finessed (see “<a href=\"http://olivier.landemaine.free.fr/loureed/poems/lrpoems.html\" target=\"_blank\">Thoughts Turn to Murder Late at Night</a>”) but his voice remains consistent.</p><p>Years later, some of Reed’s poems would find their way into print in the music magazine <i>Fusion </i>and in a 1973 booklet published by Nigel Trevena. But the Fall 1971 issue of the Advocate was likely the largest printing of Reed poems in any literary publication. Blithely discussing this in an <a href=\"http://www.brucepollockthewriter.com/2012/03/02/an-audience-with-lou-reed/\">interview</a>, Reed says, “That’s why I get a kick out of publishing poetry in rock magazines. I mean, I’ve been in <i>The Harvard</i> <i>Advocate</i>. I’ve been in some of the heaviest. But I get a kick out of being in the rock magazines because that’s the people I want to read the stuff, not the people who read <i>The Harvard</i> <i>Advocate</i>.”</p><p>Of course, in 1972, Reed rebounded from his brief retirement to release his first solo album, <i>Transformer</i> (produced, no less, by David Bowie). But has Reed’s return to songwriting completed the full-circle movement of his career? Recent developments hint that the true closure of Reed’s career might still lie in poetry. Since 2001, he has produced a musical theater piece inspired by Edgar Allen Poe, written a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/11/magazine/songs-for-the-city-laurie-sadly-listening.html\" target=\"_blank\">9/11 memorial poem</a> in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, and published a blank verse <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/244148\" target=\"_blank\">tribute to Delmore Schwarz</a> in <i>Poetry Magazine</i>. Perhaps Reed is destined after all for that liminal space of the poet-musician; perhaps decades down the road, his fans will covet, more than any actual album by the Velvet Underground, Lou Reed’s aptly and portentously titled bootleg concert tape, <i>American Poet</i>.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

By the next episode, he’s been elected to the king’s privy counsel.<span id=\"more-1722\"></span></p><p>The second episode of the series, based on Hilary Mantel’s best-selling novels, aired the night that another Hillary announced her bid for the 2016 presidential race. At the end of an extended montage-style video that nailed every demographic on its smiling, plucky middle-class head, Clinton gives the camera a grandmotherly smile.</p><p>“Everyday Americans need a champion. And I want to be that champion,” Clinton says. “So I’m hitting the road to earn your vote.”</p><p>Commentators have noted that the video signaled a marked departure from Clinton’s 2008 campaign—“I’m in to win it”—which spawned accusations of entitlement. This time around, Clinton will travel stoner-road-trip style from New York to Ohio; she’s already made news by stopping for Chipotle. “She’s trying to earn [voters’] support this time around,” a campaign advisor told <i>The New York Times.</i></p><p>In doing so, she might take a cue from Cromwell.</p><p>“Everyday Americans” (read: white, middle-class voters in swing states) are a little like 16th-century English monarchs: They like to form their own opinions. And Hilary Clinton is a little like Thomas Cromwell: She’ll make sure they form the right ones.</p><p>PBS’s <i>Wolf Hall, </i>lit almost entirely in candlelight, stands out from other Tudor-era adaptations in its remarkable subtlety. (HBO’s <i>The Tudors </i>surely featured no less than twelve ripped bodices, four botched beheadings, and at least one sensual fruit-eating scene per season). Thomas Cromwell, played with emotional depth and dynamic eyebrows by Mark Rylance, rarely speaks.</p><p>But he works hard, and he suffers. After his wife and daughters die of the sweating sickness, Cromwell shows up early to work. Bent over a pile of Cardinal Wolsey’s papers, his hands shake. “Um, when you were in France, my wife and daughters died,” he tells the cardinal, simply. As Dan Kois wrote in a smart piece for <i>Slate, </i>Cromwell “never takes work off.”</p><p>Cromwell comes from a low background, and everyone knows it. The camera often lingers on Cromwell as he enters a crowded room, eyes shifting between clusters of courtiers, like a new student looking for a spot in the cafeteria. When he joins Henry and a group of nobles at a shooting practice, one of them asks, “Who <i>are </i>you?” Cromwell ignores him, and shoots, nearly hitting the bull’s-eye. He tells the impressed king that he picked up the skill competing against the foresters and millers of his small town.</p><p>The nobles scoff, but Henry love the story. He asks Cromwell whether he might visit the town, someday, in disguise, for he so rarely sees that part of his realm (the 16th-century equivalent of a Midwestern swing state). On his third try, Cromwell hits his mark.</p><p>If Cromwell lived today, he would make an excellent candidate for the Democratic Party. Next to the shouting Henry (Ted Cruz?), he comes across as smart, humble, subdued.  He’s the ultimate underdog, and he knows it, and uses it. For, you see, the tricky thing about ambition, in both Renaissance and contemporary politics, is that you can’t let on that you have it. Whether you’re running for privy councilman or president, you must appear to work hard without really aiming for anything, sprinting on the treadmill while pretending not to know about the upcoming marathon.</p><p>When the cardinal’s corrupt, or Congress is deadlocked, it helps to be an underdog—a wry observer of the political scene, free (at least, in the imagination of the public or the king), from its sins.</p><p>Hillary Clinton, who has, after all, already <i>lived </i>in the White House, cannot be the underdog—but she can re-brand herself as one. Her campaign video shows her huddled over a table, Starbucks in hand. “I’m getting ready to run for something, too,” Clinton says in voiceover. “I’m getting ready to run for president.” Just another plucky everyday American, the announcement suggests.</p><p>The #ReadyforHillary campaign, brilliantly, does not only imply that Hillary worked her way to the top; it implies that <i>we </i>(us everyday Americans!) worked <i>for </i>her. If we thought that Hillary seemed entitled in 2008, now we feel entitled to have her. (<i>The Onion </i>satirized the slogan with the mock #IDeserveThis).</p><p>Coming from nothing, Cromwell had to overcome “Who <i>are </i>you?” With a last name that’s already followed the word “President,” Clinton has to overcome “You <i>again?”</i></p><p>Still, Cromwell and Clinton face similar tasks. Both must distance themselves from an incumbent of wavering popularity (Wolsey, Obama). Both must dismiss accusations of wrongdoing in a foreign land (Italy, Bengazi). Both must shun the curse of the “bad reputation.”</p><p>Both must work hard, without seeming obviously ambitious. Both must shape our opinions, subtly, from the shadows, while convincing us we’ve formed them ourselves.</p><p>As Cromwell kneels solemnly before the king, the scene cuts to a bawdy court play. Actors through a man, dressed as the fallen Cardinal Wolsey, into a painted devil’s mouth. Miles away, Wolsey, once the king’s most trusted advisor, dies alone.</p><p>Let it be a reminder of mercurial monarchs. Let it be a reminder of fickle, everyday, folks. Let it be a warning to Cromwell, and to Clinton.</p>",

		"body" : "<p>“Reading Djuna Barnes is like reading a foreign language, which you understand,” said Marianne Moore about her friend and contemporary near the end of Barnes’s career. “The Perfect Murder,” printed by <i>The Harvard Advocate</i> in its 1942 75<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Issue, exemplifies the curious linguistic prowess that Moore praises. In fact, the study of “foreign [languages], which you understand” is the very occupation of Barnes’s protagonist, Professor Anatol Profax, a dialectologist (specialist of tongues). A crossbreed between <em>Middlemarch</em>’s intellectually stubborn Casaubon and Baudelaire’s voyeuristic flaneurs, Profax harbors his cherished work in the crook of his elbow as he haunts the streets with a removed aspect and attentive ears. He records the “figures of speech and preferred exclamations in all walks of life” in order to classify species of speakers. He <i>bunch-indexes</i> (Barnes’s term) the inarticulate of England, France, and America as “<i>The Inveterates</i>” and devises other groupings—among them “<i>Excitable Spinsters</i>” and “<i>The Impulsive</i>”—along lines of fanaticism, eloquence, and verbosity. Profax’s scrupulous science literalizes what Moore recognized as Barnes’s genius: she paid close attention to the subtleties of expression, and did not underestimate the potential of a single language to spawn multitudinous variations.</p><p>Djuna Barnes lived first in Greenwich Village, and then in Paris, during both cities’ bohemian heydays. It was in Paris that she became acquainted with F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, like-minded contemporaries who together heralded the rise of the avant-garde. By the time “The Perfect Murder,” her last published story, appeared in <i>The Harvard Advocate</i> in 1942, Barnes was an established author. Her reputation at the time (at least within the <i>Advocate</i>) can be surmised from her inclusion in the anniversary issue, which the editors dedicated to “new material from the important figures in literature today.”</p><p><span id=\"more-884\"></span></p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/the-perfect-murder.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"The Perfect Murder\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-885\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/the-perfect-murder.jpg?w=670\"/></a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/the-perfect-murder-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"The Perfect Murder 2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-886\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/the-perfect-murder-2.jpg?w=670\"/></a></p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/the-perfect-murder-3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"The Perfect Murder 3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-888\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/the-perfect-murder-3.jpg?w=670\"/></a></p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/the-perfect-murder-4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"The Perfect Murder 4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-889\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/the-perfect-murder-4.jpg?w=670\"/></a></p><p> </p><p>By the time she wrote “The Perfect Murder,” Barnes had evidently honed her quirky voice and experimental aesthetic. The story reaches its surrealist climax when Professor Profax meets the “Elephant Woman.” What might become a romantic affair spirals into a scene of absurdity. Profax is preoccupied with the woman’s lips, but only insofar as they articulate a language that transcends his categorical science. She speaks in paradox and nonsense: “I’m a little knock-kneed … and I want to be good.” The Elephant Woman is extraordinary, an aberrant speaker, like none Profax has met or studied. But rather than cherish his discovery of a beautiful outlier, he draws a slit through her throat and so firmly delineates the categories of his dialectology. Having done the deed, the stubborn tongue-academic realizes that has forgotten to learn the single word that would have distinguished the woman from his other human specimens: her name. In the end, Professor Profax remains regretfully unchanged, regarding his human subject as a scientist would, from “behind the mists of … two sheets of glass.”</p><p>In reference to <em>Nightwood</em>, one of her most renowned works, T. S. Eliot commended that Barnes’s “prose has the prose rhythm that is prose style, and the musical pattern which is not that of verse.” Djuna Barnes’s peculiar rhythm and musicality shines through in “The Perfect Murder,” whose ethereal “Elephant Woman” seems at times to speak in a nonsensical logic guided by sound alone: “It makes all the difference in the world. I am as aboveboard as the devil. I’d like some caramels.” Statements like this, delicious despite their incomprehensibility, pervade the text, contributing to the specific and mildly foreign effect of Barnes’s prose. We must wonder about the romantic escapades of Djuna Barnes; clearly she, following in the footsteps of her Professor Profax, made a “Mistress of Sound.”</p><p> </p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

The Greek tragedies, from “Antigone” to “The Bacchae,” shed as much blood as the goriest video game, but Greek religion reserved public killing for religious sacrifices, and convention reserved onstage hitting for the comedies. Violence in the tragedies follows a law of controlled blindness: the audience can see the suicidal leap, but the fall must crash out of sight. Messenger speeches, long and breathless reports from the invisible offstage world, serve to fill in the blind spots. “Bad News!”, a staged reading co-presented in July by Poets House and River to River Festival, strings together the messenger speeches from a dozen Greek tragedies (and a few Roman, Renaissance, and contemporary takes on Greek tales). “Bad News!” explores the messenger speech as a dramatic tactic. In the process, it illuminates the figure of the messenger and explores the fraught and complex nature of bearing witness.</p><p>Seven remarkable performers — actors Bill Camp, Karen Kandel, Joan MacIntosh, Elizabeth Marvel, Efthalia Papacosta and Rocco Sisto, and singer Nora York — all play the part of Messenger. They sit on the rough stone steps that edge the Poets House courtyard, an improbable garden squeezed between apartment buildings in downtown New York and here made into a makeshift performance space. They wear everyday clothes; only the scripts in their laps distinguish the performers from the audience. The sky eases toward night, the audience falls hush, and then the performers, shot through with sudden urgency, scramble to their feet and speak.</p><p><span id=\"more-1154\"></span></p><p>Akalaitis, Attwell, and Taubman have<i> </i>excavated fourteen plays for their messenger speeches and lined up the monologues one after another. The process makes for ninety minutes of epiphany, the performers in an absurdly constant state of emergency. By the third or fourth urgent message, calamity, now routine, fails to shock.  And so focus shifts to the messenger — usually a nobody, a nameless witness who appears for one scene, describes someone else’s tragedy, and then submerges once more into the anonymity of the Chorus.</p><p>In a traditional Greek tragedy, the messenger’s moment of prominence is a public act of self-erasure, for the messenger’s bad news overshadows his or her own presence onstage. “Bad News!” traces the figure in the erasure marks. Akalaitis has arranged the messenger speeches like an orchestral score, and the monologues follow an aural logic rather than a narrative arc. The performers begin in unison, the unfamiliar sound of choral speech suggesting the cadences of young children learning lessons. Then one actor, desperate to deliver his news, breaks into a monologue. Another actor interrupts to give her message, and then another cuts in. The performers assume and discard accents and mannerisms, and at times shift into Greek, or song, or back into unison. The surfeit of interpretations makes the messenger an Everyman even as the layered voices make up a hymn to the Messenger.</p><p>Akalaitis defies recent trends toward immersive theater, 3-D movies, and onstage worlds that overflow into the audience and transform the spectators into actors. No missiles shriek toward the seats, and no blood-caked actors drag audience members onstage. “Bad News!” makes the audience witness to the event, or rather, to its telling. The audience to a Greek tragedy peers at the play’s action through the lens of the messenger speeches; the audience to “Bad News!” ignores the distant tragedy to examine the scratched and warped lens itself. The medium is the message, and in this case, the medium is human.</p><p>Of course, “Bad News!” is plain in part because it is a staged reading. But its simplicity makes the courtyard’s edge the threshold between the audience and an unseen world where anything can happen. “I was there,” the performers cry, and run onstage with messages like souvenirs from that invisible other world, <i>there, </i>where a war rages between brothers, where Jocasta learns that Oedipus is both her husband and her son, where<i> </i>a band of wild women scratch the earth and draw up milk and wine.</p><p>A glitzy staging might milk the messenger speeches for spectacle. “Bad News!” takes a gamble and foregoes visceral gut-punch, shushing the Greek tragedies’ kings, gods, and warriors in order to ask why the messengers speak. The messengers admit that delivering the bad news means reliving the painful past and risking the listeners’ anger, and yet their long monologues overflow with awful detail.</p><p>Is this hysteria? Talk therapy two thousand years before Freud?</p><p>A messenger ran from the Marathon battlefield home to Athens, cried out the news of victory, and collapsed. So the marathon was born, and so the messenger died, a story I never understood until this summer. It wouldn’t have hurt anyone if the messenger had taken a breather; it seemed to me that the messenger ran himself to death for no reason.</p><p>Now, months after the bombing at the Boston marathon endangered my friends and paralyzed my city, I still find myself talking about that day. “I was there,” I hear myself repeat. I can guess why the messengers from the story and from the plays risk everything to deliver their messages. It isn’t a sign of hysteria or a cry for attention; it is a witness’s response to tragedy. The telling transforms the messengers from helpless spectators to storytellers. It lets them salvage control from their helplessness. By reliving what should never have happened, the messengers drag the tragedy from the offstage world of possibility to the onstage world of consequence. They speak to realize what they have seen. In the process, they share the burden of witness with all the audience. “I was there,” the actors say, and now you were, too.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Reading it this time around, I have been fascinated by the relationship between the poem’s lines and their surrounding space. Just as Stevens directs our attention toward the silence that accompanies the snowy season, an emptiness that asserts itself in its negativity, so he asks us to listen more closely to the “stuff” before and after each line and stanza.</p><p><i>Stanza</i>, in Italian, means “room.” In “The Snow Man,” Stevens gives us five rooms; each room has its own white space around it, its own silence. Yet the poet does not close the door at the end of each stanza — rather, a single sentence runs <i>through</i> every room, a draft through an old house. There is a unique tension in this poem, one that pits pause against flow. The reader, straining to bridge one clause with the next, is resisted by a “nothing that is.”</p><p><span id=\"more-1313\"></span>To explore this tension more concretely, I have produced three voicings of “The Snow Man.” The first is conventional; the second incorporates more silence between each line and stanza; the third is rather extreme. I do not intend for the readings with more silence to be better than the normal one, or to say that this poem is only about poetry. I just want to show something that is perhaps obvious: that in “The Snow Man,” spatiality is special. For Stevens, tension leads to attention. To be in the world, or to read a poem, is to burrow into a place which is full of snow.</p><p>Reading 1 (Time: 1:00)</p><p>Reading 2 (Time: 1:13)</p><p>Reading 3 (Time: 1:54)</p><p><em>Illustrated by Sam Richman ’15</em></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

		"slug" : "2012-12-29-brando-acts-alone-a-response-to-jonatha",
		"body" : "<p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">The Brooklyn dockworker proles of <i>On the Waterfront</i> are D-and-D: “deaf and dumb.” They don’t hear nothing and they don’t say nothing, because they know that mob boss Johnny Friendly has a passion for shooting canaries. The system changes when luckless former boxer Terry Malloy—we know him as Marlon Brando—decides to testify against Friendly in court. That leads to the death of Brando’s brother, to Brando’s own unemployment, and to a near-death encounter at the fists of Friendly’s goons.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">We love Brando for this self-sacrifice. But what makes it the right thing to do? Jonathan Sacks, a rabbi and British parliamentarian, thinks he knows the answer. Like many sociobiology evangelists, Sacks believes that a potent brew of neurobiology, game theory, and natural selection can furnish us with a vindication of the human appetites for religion and altruism. His <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/opinion/the-moral-animal.html?src=me&amp;ref=general&amp;_r=0\">op-ed for the New York Times, “The Moral Animal,”</a> was most read on their website earlier this week.</span></p><p><span id=\"more-449\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">According to Sacks, Darwinian evolution’s main premise is that “biological and cultural makeup constitutes ‘adaptive fitness.’” In other words, our physical and behavioral traits spring from the same genealogical well. We explain both by discovering their biological utility. However, Sacks goes on to note, seemingly maladaptive tendencies have persisted in humans. Chief among these is the embrace of self-sacrificial behavior, especially of the religious variety. Though this altruism wastes our resources and diverts our individual drives to eat and procreate, Sacks claims they bolster the genetic status of our social group. The unselfishness emphasized by morality and religion gets humans to cooperate. Cooperation in a group benefits each of its distinct members. Altruism, and with it morality and religion, have been naturally selected.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">Like all prophets who claim omniscience, Sacks is peddling imperfect scripture. The first problem with his logic is that it misunderstands human nature. The primary trait that distinguishes humans from other animals is our capacity for non-genetic learning. We are born with a set of evolved instincts, but we grow up in a cultural sphere that follows its own perverse logic. Its historical changes have taken place outside the scope of evolution. For that reason, a set of good guesses about evolutionary advantage won’t tell us the full story about how we our take our coffee. Similarly, it cannot provide an exhaustive explanation for present-day altruistic beliefs.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">This problem with facts is dwarfed by a problem with theory. After claiming that evolution explains the persistence of religion in a secular age, Sacks also claims that evolution <i>justifies</i> religious belief. Given an explanation of religion as an evolved mechanism for group-bonding, we humans need to keep it in our arsenal of weapons to combat “the individualism of the consumer age.” But the social cohesion derived from religion leads to inclusion and exclusion alike: it encourages donations to hurricane relief, but it also foments violence in the Middle East. And if we could in fact justify all our behavior from natural selection, we’d also have to include a justification of human cruelty and violence. Evolution can tell us what is, but it cannot tell us what ought to be.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">Brando’s friends on the dock are reduced to animals. Friendly’s underlings choose only a few guys for work everyday, so to get a job the dockworkers must sullenly follow the rules of their harsh environment. Brando’s nobility comes from his refusal to accept this brutal struggle for existence, from his understanding that the dignity of sacrifice beats the sustenance of complacency. His act is hardly non-adaptive—it leads to fair working conditions for everyone on the dock—but its motivations are indifferent to adaptivity. Brando’s solidarity rests with himself, and his own consciousness.</span></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Image courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.theasc.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.theasc.com</a></em></p><p style=\"text-align:left;\">The architect Tadao Ando once claimed, “Walls manifest a power that borders on the violent.” Ando’s characteristic work both suppresses and celebrates this power; the architect metes thick concrete walls in sharp corners and curved interventions. Ando softens the severity of his geometric lines and reinforced concrete with painstaking attention to the location of the structure. In some works, an unexpected slit in the concrete will bathe an entire wall in sunlight. A cleverly placed window might frame a distant mountain, as though the window were serving as art.  Ando’s austerity, balanced with a delicate treatment of natural light and surrounding landscapes, rarely feels aggressive.</p><p style=\"text-align:left;\"><span id=\"more-1021\"></span></p><p style=\"text-align:left;\">But I once encountered solid walls built by Ando that were intent on sealing off the outside world entirely, and they remain perhaps the most “violent” walls I have ever faced. These walls belonged to a structure called Minamidera, erected to house an installation by James Turrell entitled <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>. Together, the structure and the artwork inside honor a temple that formerly stood at that site on Naoshima, a small fishing-island-turned-contemporary-art-destination off the coast of southern Japan. Inside Minamidera, visitors are instructed to keep silent for 15 minutes, the duration of the experience. Depending on the viewer’s eyesight, the first 5-10 minutes are spent in total darkness, after which, as pupils dilate and dilate, objects appear or seem to appear — I reserve details here to maintain the sanctity of the experience.</p><p>Minamidera embodies a hostile impulse that is amplified in Turrell’s work and suppressed in Ando’s. The hostility hits the viewer upon entry, as the work submerges the viewer in awkward cascading dualities: first light and dark, then fear and pleasure, and finally grace and ungrace. The realization that perception cannot be trusted magnifies into a worry that nothing can be trusted. When I was there, I felt at one moment as though my body could fill the entire room, and at the next as though I stood at the center of a void. Throughout, I felt huge, clumsy, and covered in skin. I heard the elephant speaker in Marianne Moore’s poem “Black Earth.” The speaker, after describing how she enjoys wading into the river where the sun can warm her back, writes,</p><p>This elephant skin</p><p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Which I inhabit, fibered over like the shell of</p><p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">The coco-nut, this piece of black glass through which no light</p><p> </p><p>Can filter—cut</p><p>Into checkers by rut</p><p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Upon rut of unpreventable experience—</p><p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">It is a manual for the peanut-tongued and the</p><p> </p><p>Hairy toed. Black</p><p>But beautiful, my back</p><p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Is full of the history of power. Of power? What</p><p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">is powerful and what is not?</p><p>In effective blindness I felt violated and yet newly connected to the silent and invisible forces of the cosmos, as if my skin were “a manual.” Perhaps this has something to do with the near-hallucinatory “Ganzfeld effect,” the phenomenon of seeing phantom forms when the eye is exposed to a uniform field, which Turrell employs in many of his works. Inside Minamidera, the blackness, “Black / But beautiful,” takes away sight and replaces it with a more mystical power — “my back is full of the history of power.” But accompanying this sense of power is awkwardness and fear, derived from the uncertainty that the walls might be moving toward each other.  To play along with Turrell’s plan for the viewer, Ando removed light — the softness that usually disguises his aggression — from his structure, creating a powerful sense of doubt as to “What is powerful and what is not?”</p><p>Without sight, the sense of a body in space is inverted. Rather than the body placed in relation to external forces, the body becomes a map for these forces. The Ganzfeld effect takes the movements of the pupils and projects them onto the colorless walls. Moore writes, “through- / Out childhood to the present time, the unity of / Life and death has been expressed by the circumference / Described by my / Trunk; nevertheless, I / Perceive feats of strength to be inexplicable after / All; and I am on my guard.” As this heightened awareness of the body as blueprint arises out of deception, the sensation is accompanied with vigilance. Ando’s walls in Minamidera indeed put me “on my guard.”</p><div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 560px\"><a href=\"http://www.artsjournal.com/culturegrrl/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TurrAtenPurp.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" \" height=\"367\" src=\"http://www.artsjournal.com/culturegrrl/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TurrAtenPurp.jpg\" width=\"550\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Aten Reign<em>, James Turrell, 2013.

Image courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.artsjournal.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.artsjournal.com</a></em></p><p>Ando often cites a visit to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Imperial Hotel in Tokyo as inspiration for his pursuit of a career in architecture. With a mammoth work of Turrell’s now occupying the central rotunda in Wright’s most iconic structure, the Guggenheim museum, Ando and Turrell share a most appropriate muse. Turrell’s giant <em>Aten Reign</em> installation in Wright’s open, airy, light-filled dome seems to supplant the restraint of <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em> with spectacle. But as the colors of the dome gradually change, viewers consider color with more care and again must reckon with the “indestructibility of matter” and the body. Moore almost perfectly describes <em>Aten Reign</em>, “that / Phenomenon / The above formation” in the same poem,</p><p>Spiritual</p><p>Brother to the coral</p><p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Plant, absorbed into which, the equable sapphire light</p><p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Becomes a nebulous green.

It is to that</p><p> </p><p>Phenomenon</p><p>The above formation,</p><p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Translucent like the atmosphere—a cortex merely—</p><p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">That on which darts cannot strike decisively the first</p><p> </p><p>Time, a substance</p><p>Needful as an instance</p><p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Of the indestructibility of matter</p><p>Moore’s elephant speaker watches “equable sapphire light” become a “nebulous green” just as <em>Aten Reign</em>’s viewers watch the saturation of each color intensify and subside. Moore’s speaker attempts to make sense of the subjectivity of perception—“the I of each is to / The I of each, / A kind of fretful speech / Which sets a limit on itself.” This attempt to reason with perception leads into an existential resignation to <i>un</i>reason: “the elephant is?”</p><p>Turrell’s work is driven by this very unreason; he submerges the viewer in dichotomies that resist rationale. While <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em> performs this submersion in utter darkness, <em>Aten Reign</em> initiates the cascade of dualities more subtly, in light. Subverting perceptual logic, his light installations ask viewers to embrace the confusion and discomfort of sensory immediacy in order to confront the impossibility of the body. Walls, whether in Ando’s stern concrete or Wright’s startling circlets, demand the same confrontation on a smaller scale. The aggression is well justified, though, for as Moore asks in the closing line of the same poem, “Will / Depth be depth, thick skin be thick, to one who can see no / Beautiful element of unreason under it?”</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

		"body" : "<p>The November 1951 issue of <i>The Harvard Advocate</i> addressed a single theme: William Faulkner. Reviews, essays, and excerpts from dissertations crowded the now-yellowed pages of the magazine, tackling everything from the author’s novels to his childhood. Two names in particular jump out from the list of contributors: Albert Camus and Thomas Mann. The <i>Advocate</i> editors were eager to milk this literary windfall, placing their names in bold print on the cover of the issue, and noting their “gracious acknowledgment” to contributors including Camus and Mann “for making this issue possible.” In the Contributors’ Notes, the two are described as follows:</p><p>“ALBERT CAMUS, possibly France’s leading contemporary novelist, has seen his novel <i>The Plague </i>translated into nearly every modern language. A critic as well as a novelist, M. Camus has read widely in American fiction.</p><p>“THOMAS MANN is perhaps the most distinguished living novelist of the twentieth century, and his fictional and critical works need doubtless no introduction.”</p><p><span id=\"more-1254\"></span></p><p>Flipping to their designated pages, however, yields an unexpected result. The “Two Letters” are certainly written by Camus and Mann; both letters, however, express regret that they are not able to contribute to the <i>Advocate</i>’s issue on William Faulkner. Misleading ploy or collegiate prank? Regardless, the publicity stunt was successful for this reader at least.</p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/baena-advo-archive-11-21-photo.jpg\"><img alt=\"baena.advo archive 11.21 photo\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1257\" height=\"893\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/baena-advo-archive-11-21-photo.jpg?w=670&amp;h=893\" width=\"670\"/></a></p><p>The text of Camus’s letter, written originally in French, is translated below:</p><p><i>Dear Sir,</i></p><p><i>I am sorry that a personal matter, complex and absorbing, prevents me from accepting your kind invitation.</i></p><p><i>I am a great admirer of William Faulkner, whose work I have known and applied for a long while.

Wheelbarrows began to transfer the bodies here in the late eighteenth century, the city’s central cemeteries groaning under the weight of their holdings. The bodies were, by then, giving off an odor that had started to seep into the central markets, clinging redolently to the fruit. Here in the so-called catacombs, skeletons from the medieval era rub shoulders with the bones of Robespierre and Marat. Tourists can pay eight euros to wander among the stacked-up skulls.</p><p>These are not the only tunnels sprawling underneath the breadth of Haussmann’s boulevards. People tend to forget that much of the southern part of Paris is constructed on a delicate crust, fault lines slicing just atop a porous mantle. You remember only when there is a collapse, a whole southeastern neighborhood, for instance, that crumbled into its foundations back in the sixties. The tunnels were quarries, at first: it was their stones that built the city when the south was no more than barren land, when builders could cart their materials from here over to the Panthéon and the Louvre. As Paris’s borders were teased outwards, construction overlaid the old quarries, sealing them in like streets under the dried lava of Pompeii. There are almost two-hundred miles of these pathways coursing beneath the urban lanes.</p><p><span id=\"more-1084\"></span></p><p>Of the intrepid pioneers who seek to probe the quarries’ depths, Emilien R. is a typical case. At twenty-three, he is jagged-nosed and tall, with big hands and feet that give him a pieced-together, gangly look. He has just graduated from a prestigious French university, and he’s smart, sharply funny, though if caught at a quiet moment a sort of desperate wild streak might briefly muddy his eyes. It is summertime now and he is not sure what he’ll do next. But tonight he is the leader of an intimate gang of <i>cataphiles</i>, lovers of the catacombs, a term employed more often by the media than by the practitioners themselves. He hands out headlamps, stuffs beers into the backpacks of each friend, and tells the group to follow him. It is nearly eleven o’clock.</p><p>From Denfert-Rochereau it is a short metro ride south-west, then a hike a few blocks north, where Emilien turns and stops. One by one the group members hoist themselves over a fence and ease down a hill to an abandoned train track and tunnel. They walk for what seems like miles into the gaping hollow, until there’s no longer light from behind and none yet from up ahead. Emilien studies a map. He shines his headlamp onto the right-hand side of the tunnel, the faint beam illuminating a small oval hole. Ducking down to crawl through headfirst, he says, “This is it,” and one by one each ducks down after him, emerging into a damp limestone alley barely two meters tall.</p><p>Until 1955, when entering the catacombs was made illegal, they were easier to reach: there were entrances in parks, under staircases, in the basements of the Latin Quarter’s prestigious private schools. During World War II, you sometimes hear, French members of the Résistance used the tunnels as headquarters, as did the German occupiers. Underground battles ensued, perhaps, muffled by the earth above. Or maybe just a truce and quick exchange of cigarettes. Beginning in the sixties, the police began to seal these entrances. Now they are harder to get to and it’s never clear, upon arrival, if they’ll still be open. The police patrol inside, sometimes, handing out tickets, a sixty-five euro fine. This deters some but not others.</p><p>Emilien, for example, comes down here often. He has just begun to bring his girlfriend; he has friends among the Thursday-night regulars. Many are young, college-aged or in their twenties, and remind you of Emilien: a Dean Moriarty type, a kind of intelligence with an itch to escape, burrowing under Paris instead of hurtling across the American plains. You can track down these groups through voices, lights, or someone’s tinny iPhone music. Every so often the winding alleys empty out into a columned cavern, which reveals them, huddled around candles, drinking, hanging out.</p><p>There are slabs of stone in these caverns worn down with decades of use. There are plaques ensconced every so often within the alleyways with names of streets — Rue Dareau, Rue Feuillantine — vague reminders of a time before the passages were ossified below-ground. When it rains, puddles clog the alleys: you can avoid them at first, but are soon slogging through up to a few feet of water (“Don’t wear any clothes you care about,” Emilien tells his guests). If there were a leak or rainstorm the <i>cataphiles</i>’ chances would not look good.</p><p>There is a middle-aged man here, too, a caretaker at the Luxembourg Gardens, who has been coming down for sixteen years. (“How often do you <i>descendre</i>?” they ask each other, “who was here last week when I couldn’t <i>descendre</i>?”) In the seventies, they remind each other, there were real parties, punk raves and neon lights, drugs and music and late-night glee. It was the definitive alternative scene.</p><p>It’s quieted down by now. To <i>descendre, </i>now, is to enter a world stiller and calmer than above. It is an oddly melancholy realm, chilled and damp even on a muggy July night, where you could stay for days and, like the Chilean miners, never know how long you’ve been gone. Where the hours’ strictures lose their urgency, if only for a time; where you can wander and forget, and maybe escape whatever needs escaping, if only for a night. There is no reason to whisper, and yet everyone does — awed, perhaps, and at once sobered and enthralled. Enthralled, at least, until the food runs out and the beer bottles are empty, and you’re cold and wet and ready to return, and you crawl back and out and up into the cobblestoned street in the fourteenth arrondissement, where café-goers look askance at the skinny, sooty teenagers emerging from a manhole, explorers who were out looking for an adventure, perhaps one of the last that can so easily be found.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Things change during the summer. My family eats a lot of chicken and seafood; I eat out more. Red meat, however, continues to account for a negligible percentage of my diet. It’s not that I dislike red meat; I just tend not to seek it out. I’ll order a lightweight red meat appetizer (steak tartare anyone?) but, for me, if a porterhouse is on the menu it might as well not be.</p><p>This past month, however, I visited rural Colorado. I was there for eight days, including one night in Denver, and I ate red meat on every single one of them.</p><p>Day one was beef cheek at The Squeaky Bean. It was not nearly as pretty as the revelatory Brussels sprouts it had the misfortune of following (cooked in fish sauce and studded with Old Bay cornflakes), but I ended up enjoying the cheek more – not because it was better than the Brussels sprouts, but because it was so much better than I expected it to be. I had never had beef cheek before; at least, I cannot remember having had beef cheek before. I expected to derive less pleasure from eating the dish than from thinking about eating it. Taste-wise, I anticipated chewiness.</p><p>I was totally, spectacularly wrong. I knew it when my fork sunk into the cheek almost entirely of its own accord. It fell apart like brisket. I could see the juices in between the threads of meat, which retreated from one another as if they carried a like magnetic charge. I hate to use the phrase melt-in-your mouth (mostly because it is often misused to mean merely delicious), but that’s what we’re dealing with: melt-in-your-mouth, and deeply flavorful.</p><p>It was the only beef cheek I had in Colorado, and also to date. Actually, in spite of the sheer amount of red meat I consumed that week, I managed not to repeat a single dish. I failed to notice this until the final day of my trip – that I had, in a way, eaten tremendously widely: ribs, carne asada, elk, lengua. I even tried a bite of Jack Link’s beef jerky (though how much actual red meat figured in its production is questionable).</p><p>While I don’t consciously avoid red meat, I think that my tendency not to eat it under ordinary circumstances evinces tacit acquiescence to the idea that it is unhealthy. Or rather, healthy only in strict moderation. My week of hyper-carnivorousness has not changed my sort-of opinion. I did not emerge from the Rockies an unabashed lover of all meats red; I don’t plan on casually consuming it for work-lunch or weeknight-dinner. But I hope I can break my habit of ignoring its presence in the entrée section of restaurant menus. I could do with a steak now and then. Or an elk burger or beef cheek.The beef cheek set a high bar – one that only the ribs and the lengua managed to meet. What struck me was not the quality of the individual dishes, but the sheer number of guises in which the umbrella food had been presented to me. When I think “red meat,” my brain conjures up an image of a plain cut of beef: lone, imposing, and to my mind unappetizing. At some point, I dismissed red meat in its more ordinary forms, came to regard it as a pat variable powerless to surprise or impress me. But surely, if I can be struck dumb by lengua, if I can wholeheartedly enjoy a half of an elk burger, than a simple, well-prepared steak is nothing to turn up my tempeh-loving nose at.</p><p><em>Reblogged from<a href=\"https://feedmeeatmore.wordpress.com/2014/08/29/red-meat-in-colorado/\"> Feed Me Eat More</a></em></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

		"body" : "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"721\" src=\"https://storiesneverending.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/last-samurai.jpg?w=484&h=721\" width=\"484\"></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lik</span>e many unjustly marginal books, Helen DeWitt’s <i>The Last Samurai</i> is a novel that makes you want to proselytize. It makes you want to blog about it, laud it to your friends, brandish it in high-transit places in the hopes that another intrepid reader, impelled by the novel’s aura of genius, will come along and ask about it.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span id=\"more-1817\"></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s also a novel that rewards you for your efforts by not being impenetrable: risking unintelligibility only when necessary and avoiding an elliptical narrative in favor of chronological dullness, so that you’ll always be on solid footing, no matter how outré things get. (Depending on your tolerance, they get either over- or underwhelmingly outré.) It’s for this reason, I think, that <i>The Last Samurai</i> has survived fifteen years of abysmal levels of popularity with the general readership—DeWitt’s book is ultimately empowering and decidedly feel-good, leaving its readers with the sense that they’ve grasped a complicated whole, that they too can be as perceptive a reader as the precocious polymath/incorrigible linguistic dilettante at the novel’s center, Ludo, a really smart 11 year-old. But even though <i>The Last Samurai</i> since its publication in 2000 has become a critical workhorse, crowning <a href=\"http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/2007/32390/\"><span class=\"s2\">self-congratulatory lists of under-appreciated books</span></a>, it seems to have definitively missed its opportunity to become one of those generation-defining novels miming or critiquing (who can tell which?) the informational promiscuity of the early Internet—think <i>Infinite Jest</i>, <i>White Teeth</i>, <i>The Corrections</i>, and some other now-unavoidable novels you and I could name (maybe something by Pynchon?). I learned from the back cover of DeWitt’s synchronic <i>Lightening Rods</i> that <i>The Last Samurai </i>has been translated into 20 languages, but after some unenlightening Google searches for its title translated, I’m still wondering whether the book has roused significant devotion in Brazil or Poland. In the anglophone world, at least, the book has gone out of print, but you can still find secondhand copies. (A friend gave me one as a gift, and I am indebted.)</span><!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more--></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Unpopularity, though, might be exactly what <i>The Last Samurai </i>was looking for. It might not be obvious, but perhaps the most weighty part of DeWitt’s project is that it<i> </i>self-consciously projects its own importance beyond the scope of its readership. It’s as if <i>The Last Samurai</i> assumes that in the far future, our current knowledge—like our language or daily practices—will be erased or changed beyond recognition and presumes to record the indispensable to safeguard it within its pages. In this way, <i>The Last Samurai</i> is like a dream of the Internet after humans die off or a preemptive and curatorial Noah’s Ark; it predicts and forestalls the wholesale destruction of public and private knowledge by virtue of its very existence.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">This might sound extreme. Let me explain myself. <i>The Last Samurai</i> has not gone out of print to form a strange underground economy of appreciation (copies seem to circulate hidden in plain sight; I found one in Harvard’s Farnsworth Room, which calls itself “an eclectic leisure reading collection”) because it’s just hard to read or too virulently perverse to be appreciated by the uninitiated. Factor out DeWitt’s singular diction and the bits of Japanese, Ancient Greek, and Icelandic that periodically appear in the text, and <i>The Last Samurai</i> is just the story of a Sibylla, the single mother raising Ludo, the brilliant child we already mentioned, in London. Sibylla is the daughter of an intellectually-frustrated father, and finding herself in a world offering nothing but philistinism and boredom at every turn, she becomes pretty intellectually frustrated herself. Meanwhile Ludo longs to find a suitable father around which to structure his identity and goes around telling interesting or noteworthy men that he is their lost son. The story is partially an absurdist ready-made, and that’s part of its comfort. At the same time, DeWitt exhausts the book’s main intertext, Akira Kurosawa’s <i>Seven Samurai</i>, to parallel Ludo’s intellectual development as he wages emotional war with his faux fathers under the pretense of genealogy. Cannibalistic in his quest for knowledge that could one day prove vital, Ludo ingests everything—but mostly books and the intellectual identities of these men. “I’ve had to learn five major trade languages and eight nomadic languages just in case,” Ludo remarks as he first prepares for belated father-son bonding, “It’s insane.” But once he has learned what he needs to know from the men in his life, it’s as if they didn’t exist, as if he’s killed them off. Too indicatively, many of his encounters with a spurious father are prefaced by the lines<i>,</i> “He raises the bamboo sword. He draws it back with beautiful economy,” reminding us that Ludo is the eternal protagonist of the following scene in <i>Seven Samurai</i>.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">[Kyuzo] fights a match with another samurai with a bamboo sword. He wins, but the other man claims it was a draw. So Kyuzo says, if we’d been fighting with real swords, I’d have killed you. So the other samurai says, All right, let’s fight with real swords. So Kyuzo says, It’s silly, I’ll kill you. So the other samurai draws his sword, and they fight with real swords, and he’s killed.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"407\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/7mw6LyyoeGE?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"670\"></iframe></span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">In fact, this question of genealogy, deliberate ruptures within it, and the death of the weaker is thematically crucial, for soon it becomes clear that, were Ludo the last person on the planet to know everything about it—were he cognitively the last samurai standing—he would be able to reconstruct major triumphs of world culture, from post-conceptual art to hyper-masculine colloquial Japanese. Tellingly, for most of its duration, <i>The Last Samurai</i> is his diary. Thus Ludo becomes the perfect conduit for producing a text that could serve as a Greatest Hits in contemporary civilization; the text is a geography of his mind, of the world’s mind.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Georg Lukács in <i>The Theory of The Novel</i> observes with twentieth-century certitude that “A totality that can be simply accepted is no longer given to the forms of art: therefore they must either narrow down and volatilize whatever has to be given form to the point where they can encompass it, or they must show polemically the impossibility of achieving their necessary object and the inner nullity of their own means.” We could say that <i>The Last Samurai</i> does the former by arguing against the latter. Ludo’s limitlessness is the fever dream of a novel that seeks to demonstrate the transmit-ability of all knowledge along with the viability of fiction as a repository for a species of totality—a self-sustaining web of references. In less grating language, I might say that <i>The Last Samurai</i> champions fiction as a device for creating worlds that simultaneously gives the reader all that she needs to survive in these worlds. (This is what I mean by ‘self-sustaining.’ Whether <i>The Last Samurai</i> presumes to represent one of the totalities of of our world is a thornier debate.) The text as a guide for survival is not only evident in Ludo’s frontiersman-throwback, <i>Seven Samurai</i>-flavored rhetoric (“I think I could live off the land in any continent.”) but more stealthily in Sibylla’s musings on pedagogy and literature and in the very processes whereby Ludo learns to interpret the world. Take how Sibylla shows Ludo Ancient Greek at four years old for instance.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> There are a lot of Greek letters that are like English letters. See if you can read this, and I wrote on a piece of paper:</span></em></p><p class=\"p4\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> ατ</span></em></p><p class=\"p4\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> And he said at.</span></em></p><p class=\"p4\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> And I wrote down βατ and he said bat.</span></em></p><p class=\"p4\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> And I wrote down εατ and he said eat.</span></em></p><p class=\"p4\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> ατε. ate. ιτ. it. κιτ. kit. τοε. toe. βοατ. boat. αβουτ. about.</span></em></p><p class=\"p4\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> And I said that’s good.</span></em></p><p class=\"p4\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> And I said There are some other letters that are different, and I wrote down γ = g, δ = d, λ = l, μ = m, ν = n, π = p, ρ = r, & σ = s & I said see if you can read these.</span></em></p><p class=\"p4\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> I wrote down γατε and he said Gate!</span></em></p><p class=\"p4\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> And I wrote down δατε and he said Date!</span></em></p><p class=\"p4\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> And I wrote down λατε and he said Late!</span></em></p><p class=\"p4\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> ματε. Mate! ρατε. Rate! λετ Let μετ Met νετ Net πετ Pet σετ!!!!!!</span></em></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">This goes on for a while, and eventually Ludo learns the corresponding phonology and portions of the Ancient Greek lexicon—this is not the point. What’s <i>really</i> fascinating about Sybilla’s Ancient Greek pedagogy is that her efforts to make her son literate in Greek illustrate her preoccupations with the future of rarified knowledge. Only a few pages earlier, we find her making the following comments on the Rosetta Stone with Ludo’s soon-to-be biological father.</span></p><p class=\"p4\" style=\"text-align:left;\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> I said What I mean is, though I believe the Stone was originally a rather pompous thing to erect, it was a gift to posterity. Being written in hieroglyphics, demotic, and Greek, it only required that one language survive for all to be accessible. Probably one day English will be a much-studied dead language; we should use this fact to preserve other languages to posterity. You could have Homer with translation and marginal notes on vocabulary and grammar, so that if that single book happened to be dug up in 2,000 years or so the people of the day would be able to read Homer, or better yet, we could disseminate the text as widely as possible to give it the best possible chance of survival.</span></em></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"> What we should do, I said, is have legislation so that every book published was obliged to have, say, a page of Sophocles or Homer in the original with appropriate marginalia bound into the binding, so that even if you bought an airport novel if your plane crashed you would have something to reread on the desert island…</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Note Sybilla’s intense preoccupation with preserving textual intelligibility in a future where her language is a relic, her vague but repetitious use of <i>posterity</i> and <i>survive</i>, and the ostentatiously urgent tone of the plane-crash scenario. It will escape no one’s attention that Dewitt has engineered <i>The Last Samurai</i> so that, in the case of an emergency or personal inclination, the attentive reader could use it to learn Ancient Greek. (As you’d figure, Sybilla later writes her own Rosetta Stone for Greek.) Relatedly, earlier in this section, she finds herself “hearing in my mind snatches of books which might exist in three or four hundred years.” And if it didn’t already, this dialogue takes on an increasingly eschatological tone. About a decade later, Ludo seems to pick up his mother’s rôle in his first conversation with his biological father, a bad, popular writer. “Do you ever bury your books?” asks Ludo, now citing the possibility of “cataclysm” and again the idea future societies’ investigative excavations (“a few metres down, one on each continent”). Unsurprisingly, that inseparable couplet of “preserve” and “posterity” also comes up in Ludo’s speech, and we wonder wether what DeWitt wants to do here is remind us that in all text there is the potential to memorialize at the expense of Lukácsian self-reflexivity, to select one’s totality, to keep some fragments of previous literature alive while leaving others to wither in posterityless obscurity. (I have no doubt that DeWitt has buried her own books somewhere.)</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Of course, it’s not only Ancient Greek that gets this treatment. Glossing dialogue from resonant scenes in <i>Seven Samurai</i>, DeWitt also breaks down Japanese so as to be comprehensible with some effort. She reproduces a Hiragana chart, both fundamental and abstruse Kanji, and a bulk of handy phrases in the text to accord with Ludo’s efforts to learn the language. The same goes for the Icelandic, whose North Germanic syntax and vocabulary require little intervention. You’ll also find some Inuit, Arabic, Finnish, and scraps of additional languages and glosses. With all of this, DeWitt seems to argue that for world culture to protect itself from inevitable decay, we need texts to become consumable,and thus intelligible, not independently but in the gap between one language or another. Education, accordingly, must become at once ubiquitous (“airport novels”) and incisive (by using one language to elicit another). Nevertheless, this logic of preservation through cleverer teaching extends beyond the linguistic. Through sensuous descriptions, conversations, edifying asides, or Ludo’s constant recitations of accreted knowledge, DeWitt manages to give readers a decent notion of some of the flashiest cornerstones in intellectual progress thus far. Flipping <i>Samurai</i>’s pages almost at random, I compiled this incomplete, possibly representative list.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Contemporary classical music infatuated with the idea of sound as an event.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Explanations of atomic theory accessible to an untrained understanding.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Carl Friedrich Gauss’s famous shortcut for adding up a bunch of sequential numbers.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Contemporary linguistic fieldwork resulting in dramatic sociolingustic conclusions (“There was an indicative, past present and future, and an imperative, and these were used only by men—and then there were what he would call by analogy the subjunctive and the optative, and these were used only by women.”)</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Visual art that challenges the notion that seeing is passive while advancing projects that thrive on viewer-artist intersubjectivity (“Then he let out the bloody water, and he sold the first set of bloody canvas for £150,000. It was called Let Brown = Red.”)</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Naturalistic film’s aesthetic of viewer immersion.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Self-consciously formulaic <i>phrases bateaux</i>. (“La formule est banale”)</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Serendipitous patterns in basic arithmetic.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Presence or absence of what could be called perspective in Japanese woodblock prints of the</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">nineteenth century in conversation with</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Second Viennese School-era music theory.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Hamlet’s “To be or not to be” soliloquy and accompanying polemics surrounding the moral</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">legitimacy of suicide.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Where better to preserve these riches than in a work of fiction, with its ability to operate across languages and broad swaths of knowledge, with its ability to become the ultimate self-reproducing commodity? (What’s more cunningly preservationist than a book that generates a cult readership?) This vision of fiction is what DeWitt in her novel unerringly promotes. Criticisms of <i>The Last Samurai</i> could rage from the legitimate complaint that much of the text is irritatingly allegorical to the possible turn-off of much of DeWitt’s David Foster Wallacian verbal tics (among these, a nasty fetish for initialisms), but no one can say that DeWitt has not exploited the fictional narrative’s natural way of expanding to do what is demanded of it. For this reason, this mobilization of the book as a decentralized, referential, transitive object that generates interest in the reader commensurate with the author’s investment makes <i>The Last Samurai</i> more of a self-aware artifact than a novel. In its paranoid desire to preserve, <i>The Last Samurai</i> forcibly introduces itself—along with all the information with which it is pregnant—into an un-lived future, a hypothetical future which might as well be real, in which it is one of those books excavated by a temporally-distant society for examination. Neither I, nor you, nor anyone can read this book as if it were the last book we—all of us here—had left behind. But let’s imagine what that might be like. Let’s imagine that some literary altruist had been prudent enough to catalogue some of our world’s advancements in the guise of an eclectic work of fiction—an impressionistic and highly-selective Voyager Golden Record. How much of us would survive? How much would be obliterated by virtue of omission? It’s this anxiety of existential fragility that fuels <i>The Last Samurai</i> and makes it so damn good. As mortal readers, we root for DeWitt because in the survival of her words is our survival, the survival of our mundanity, the invisible air of knowledge that we all breathe without thinking about it.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><em><br></em></p><p class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\r\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\r\n\r\n</p>\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

His page is a visual canvas, upon which words are not simply sounds that peal back to produce meaning, but aesthetic objects laid out upon the page.</p><p>E.E. Cummings was born and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at 104 Irving Street, just a stone’s throw from Annenberg Hall – where Harvard’s freshman now dine. He was the son of a Harvard Professor – Edward Cummings – who had been one of the first Professors of Harvard’s burgeoning Sociology Department. Born and raised within the echoes of student’s footsteps as they rushed to class, Cummings would enter its gates as a freshman in September 1911, although he would continue to live at home until his Senior Year.</p><p><span id=\"more-93\"></span></p><p>During his time at Harvard, Cummings was known for his tastes in avant-garde music and literature, and for being a member of <i>The Harvard Advocate</i> and a founding editor of another literary publication, the <i>Harvard Monthly</i>. Having written poetry every day from an early age, a number of Cummings’ poems written during his time at Harvard were published in <i>The Harvard Advocate. </i></p><p>The poems “Summer Silence” and “Sunset” were both published in different editions of <i>The Harvard Advocate </i>in March 1913 – when Cummings would have been a Sophomore. The first of the two, “Summer Silence,” is written in Spenserian Stanza – a fixed verse form created by Edmund Spenser for his epic poem <i>The Faerie Queen. </i>The Spenserian Stanza is composed of nine lines, eight of which are in iambic pentameter, and the last of which is in iambic hexameter. (A structure to which the poem does conform, with the exception of the sixth line, “The empty vault of Night with shimmering bars,” which adds a final unstressed syllable to the end of the line, a departure from the five feet line known as a feminine ending.) The second of the pair, “Sunset,” is written as a sonnet and, in this manner, both poems register a sharp comparison to Cummings’ later, structurally experimental poetry.</p><p>Although both poems consort with traditional forms and seek to convey a single, externally conceived experience, some images and word constructions in each poem betray traces of Cummings’ later dictatorship of language – how he will create and synthesize words to formulate new meanings, or how he will revise grammatical laws to suit his poetical needs. For example, in “Summer Silence,” Cummings uses the phrase “Limply, down-sagging” to describe the air. Although the synthesis of “down” and “sagging” is not particularly surprising, his dissolution of the gap between two signifiers already signals a frustration with language and its inadequacy, that will force him to devise new linguistical rules and forms in later years. Or let us compare this image of the air, whose limpness is distressing and almost perverse, with two lines from Cummings’ poem “spring!may-” published in 1952:</p><p>(the earth and the sky</p><p>are one today)</p><p>In “Summer Silence,” the air sags down near to the earth, but in a manner that is uncomfortable, stagnant. In the lines above from “spring!may-”, just as in “Summer Silence,” the earth and the sky merge, coalesce; yet in this later poem, Cummings’ language is direct and unadorned (a mark of his later verse); whilst the image of the sky and earth merging is something positive, and reinforcing.</p><p>But perhaps a comparison of Cummings’ earlier poetry published here in <i>The Harvard Advocate</i> to his later, matured style is not necessary or constructive. For, regardless of what Cummings will produce later, the imagery utilized in “Sunset” is intrinsically visceral, and successfully makes concrete the grandeur of a fleeting impression. He uses a metaphor for sunset as the light stitching up the “shroud” of the dead day– this move is powerful, and although somber, poetic. Moreover, the poem talks about “day’s fillets” from which “Night shakes out her locks,” where the use of the word “fillets” suggests surgical amputation. The poem is dark and almost terrifying in its depiction of a sunset. Yet it is in this ability to excite mood and emotion, often in a manner that leaves one confused as to how this emotion has arisen, where Cummings’ talent lies.</p><p>By Sarah Hopkinson ’13</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

He often describes Castro’s Cuba as “1984 if Charles Dickens had written it,” and in his experience, Olympic-grade boxers struggling to leave Cuba without trading in their Cubanness for international cash are some of the story’s most dogged protagonists. He’s interviewed celebrities from Mike Tyson to Slavoj Žižek, hustled tourists at chess, and had an affair with Castro’s granddaughter.</span><span id=\"more-1770\"></span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We spoke near Union Square in Manhattan over iced coffee that only partially staved off the city’s infernal summer heat. With his ultimate fighter physique and pleasant attitude, Butler reminds me of either a bald Matt Damon or Residente, the lead signer of the Puerto Rican rap fusion band <i>Calle 13</i> (Butler says he gets the Puerto Rican thing a lot.) He’s got a Canadian propensity to taking himself with humor (he assures me that this trait is endemically Canadian),and a practiced speed-chess player’s rapid-fire articulacy. We talked about his work, the work of Italo Calvino, books in general, Goya, Quebec, the democratization of information, billionaires, the inhumanity and erotic iconography of bullfights, and the Hungarian language. The portion of this conversation having to do with Cuba is reproduced below.</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Lucas Quatrecasas:</strong> So, in his talk on the “baroque and the marvelous real,” [the Cuban novelist] Alejo Carpentier says that “America, a continent of symbiosis, mutations, vibrations, <i>mestizaje</i>, has always been baroque…” You often write of Cuba, of Havana as a city, as a place of this sensory excess; there always seems to be too much going on, too much beauty to take in at once. But at the same time you note that Havana has this profoundly human element. It’s totally different from the kind of sensory excess engendered by late capitalism: advertisement, conspicuous consumption, etc… What did it feel like to walk into this totally different kind of “baroque”?</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Brin-Jonathan Butler:</strong> In a way it feels like something from that society, that culture, throws a love letter to you that’s stuffed inside a Molotov cocktail. And if it doesn’t ignite and blow you away, you try as I did with this book [<i>The Domino Diaries</i>] to throw it back, return fire. And I think that’s what this book is. It is a love letter where there’s a viciousness encompassing all those contradictions and paradoxes. So entering Havana one of the first things I identified as a profound confrontation to where I come from is hearing “prepare yourself for the poverty of Cuba.” True—but strictly in a materialist context. So, OK, I’m ready for that. My mother came from Budapest, she came from communism; she left as a refugee, her father left as a refugee. Tanks were rolling through the streets. But she had no nostalgia for where she’d come from, whereas Cubans have profound nostalgia for where they come from.</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">So the first thing I notice is that there’s no advertising making people feel bad to create a need to consume things to deal with your emotional void, your inadequacy. So what happens? Women seem very confident, anywhere you go. Their children feel safe to go everywhere. There wasn’t a sense of the isolation that wealth and luxury provide. </span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>LQ:</strong> A sense of private space separated from public space.</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>BJB:</strong> Right. I mean, literally, the walls are crumbling everywhere; everything is falling apart. But what’s the byproduct of that metaphorically? Well, if the walls are all crumbling down you can see into everyone’s house. You cannot avoid what you’re looking at in terms of feeling compassion for how people are struggling and for how you yourself are struggling. So that identification of being part of a struggle, together, is something I don’t think is part of our experience in the United States of today, where if you have money, what’s the first thing you do with it? Build walls.</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>LQ:</strong> Keep retreating into that private space…</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>BJB:</strong> Have bigger space and less people living in it. Even in Vancouver, where I came from, over the past thirty years you now have half the amount of families residing in twice the amount of space. But I definitely felt, walking into those houses, that people who had money, living in security, were not generous. And that’s an interesting thing to encounter in Cuba: how generous people are with nothing. And I think that’s because not having enough and striving to get it is far less taxing than having and and losing it or being afraid of having it stolen, which is our system.</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Socialism advocates largely to get past yourself, to start looking around. The way you’re benefitting in terms of healthcare, education—that’s because of the sacrifice of other people who risked their lives to build a society. The bottom is the biggest beneficiary of the massive institutional transitions that were created. And Castro, let’s remember, came from the ruling class; he came from money. He had an easy life being paid as a lawyer, and still he looked out for blacks, especially rural blacks, illiterate blacks, the proletariat… And they did do considerably better than they did pre-revolution, which is why you saw that those who were white and those who had money left. Why?</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>LQ:</strong> Because they were there ones whose interests were at stake…</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>BJB:</strong> They were the ones losing factories.</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" aligncenter\" height=\"682\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Guillermo_Rigondeaux_after_the_win_vs._Rico_Ramos_20JAN2012_Las_Vegas_-_Palms_Casino.jpg\" width=\"1024\"/></p><p class=\"p6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>This is a picture of Rigondeaux in 2012, after he had already gone professional.</i></span></p><p class=\"p6\" style=\"text-align:left;\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>LQ:</strong> Well, for me what seemed kind of paradoxical about that was that these Cuban boxers that flee Cuba under such, like, <i>invasive</i> surveillance—I mean the biggest example is [Olympic champion] Guillermo Rigondeaux, who fled Cuba in 2009 and was later on ridiculed and derided, even his father turned against him. But he seemed to be chasing, if not just success, a standard version of the American Dream. How does that ideology start to pervade the Cuban system, when we’ve disowned it?</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>BJB:</strong> I think—speaking to that paradox of being proud to be Cuban and wanting to retain the cultural benefits of what’s been established while at the same time making a lot more money—that’s every Cuban. Nobody aspires to be the proletariat. Nobody aspires to be poor—because it’s so fun, right? But Che would have you believe that they do, that just through benevolence, or reaching for benevolence, everybody can be thrilled to join ration lines and that kind of thing. That has not worked out. I’ve never met a Cuban who was like, “I’m thrilled to have to wait three hours every morning to get bread for my family.” No, it’s disgraceful. And when there’s no bread to have, and your kids are going to starve, people would go out on the street and scream, “Fuck you. Fuck the system. What I’m seeing on television and what I’m seeing every time Fidel comes to give a seven hour speech—this is not the life that we’re living.” Which is why I have the chapter on “if Spanish lacked a future tense, he [Fidel Castro] would be speechless.” Because it’s all broken promises. So that’s a big part of the frustration. But it’s not, on the other hand, like people don’t believe in social justice as a principle, care about the welfare of the absolute weakest and the most vulnerable. It’s just that the institutional corruption that necessitates people to have to deal with the black market—which is bigger than the existing, official economy—in order to survive, that breeds such resentment and bitterness of this inner split between the official person I have to be and the real person I have to be to survive. And they know the government understands it. So there’s this tacit, implicit understanding of what people are going to do, since nobody could survive if they all obeyed the laws.</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">So, Rigondeaux. He knows he has to jump on a smuggler’s boat. Does he have ten to fifty thousand dollars to pay for it? No. Well, whoever’s paying that fee—he [Rigondeaux] obviously feels he owes it to them to pay it off and probably has to sign an extensive contract for these services, where they’re receiving a third of his income once he becomes a professional boxer. Is he thrilled about signing a contract for five years for fifty dollars? No. But the the rumor that I heard is that he was signing more contracts than autographs. Why? Because he had no understanding of the legal system once he came over here, which to me does seem a lot like indentured servitude. </span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>LQ:</strong> There’s actually a scene in your memoir that I thought was intriguing if not hallucinatory. You described seeing Rigondeaux before you met him, you couldn’t see his face, he was totally obscured, and then after winning a fight he holds up a picture of Castro and just puts it over his face. What do you make of that gesture in the light of his flight from Cuba and everything that came after that?</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>BJB:</strong> Well, the Olympic team is by appointment, it’s not a meritocracy. Their attitude is that the only superstar in Cuba, as far as sports is concerned, is the system that’s producing all these great champions: “If you think you’re bigger than the system, we’re not concerned, there’s going to be more where you came from. We’ll find another one of you in Santiago de Cuba, in any back alley.” So that was something that was really intriguing in Rigondeaux’s case. He thought, “I’m the crown jewel that Fidel has for boxing. Even if this goes wrong in Brazil [during his 2007 a</span> <span class=\"s1\">ttempt to defect from the Cuban team at the Pan-American games], he’s going to have to take me back so that I can win a third gold medal.” And Castro was like, “forget <i>that</i>.”</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" aligncenter\" height=\"482\" src=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/hb/hb_37.45.3.41.jpg\" width=\"650\"/></p><p class=\"p6\" style=\"text-align:center;\">Giovanni Battista Piranesi, <i>Parte di ampio magnifico Porto all’uso degli antichi Romani (Part of a spacious magnificent harbor in the manner of the ancient Romans) </i>(ca. 1749–50) Piranesi’s fantastical reconstructions of a crumbling Rome form an invisible city comparable to those of Calvino or Havana. Many of his etchings seem hallucinated, even totally impossible, and bear the unmistakable character of a city stuck somewhere in the past.</p><p class=\"p6\"><strong>LQ:</strong> In your memoir, I was excited by the references to Italo Calvino’s Invisible Cities; I thought that they were really apt, and there was a quotation that I wanted to read from later on in the book from his description of a “continuous city”: “You have given up trying to understand whether, hidden in some sac or wrinkle of these dilapidated surroundings there exists a Penthesilea the visitor can recognize and remember, or whether Penthesilea is only the outskirts of itself. The question that now begins to gnaw at your mind is more anguished: outside Penthesilea does an outside exist? Or, no matter how far you go from the city, will you only pass from one limbo to another, never managing to leave it?” Does that speak to the experience that you and other Cubans—especially these boxers—have had of Havana? Does it follow you?</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>BJB:</strong> Oh absolutely. That Thomas Wolfe [book], “You Can’t Go Home Again.”—I think it’s the opposite: you can never leave home. There’s another line in Calvino, in Invisible Cities; and I don’t think I included it, but I probably should have. It’s when Kublai Khan—it’s about two thirds of the way through—confronts Marco Polo and says “OK, you’ve told me about all of these different cities, but the one you haven’t mentioned is where you come from: Venice.” And Polo says, “What else do you think I’ve been talking to you about?” That to me is so interesting because it comes back to the first line of the book [<i>The Domino Diaries</i>], which is that the subject of every interview is how you can’t learn much about anyone from an interview. Similarly, there is no way I can ask a question of anybody that reveals more about them then it does about me. And that’s the bind we’re all stuck in. I’m curating all of these experiences, and I’m ostensibly trying to project:, “Here’s what I’ve discovered.” But more so I think I’m burrowing in to illuminate <i>me</i>: these are the things that caught my eye, but how much did I miss?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Ninety-nine percent of what I saw is not included because it doesn’t vibrate these internal sensors of what’s relevant; and that speaks to where you come from. For Cubans, once they leave, the desperation is like, “I’m on this deserted island collecting diamonds, but I have nowhere to cash them in, and I have no loved ones to share the riches with. And I don’t have the culture that I want to be in.” Their perception is that they go to Miami, close themselves off, stay with Cubans. Rigondeaux arrived here in February of 2009, so we’re what, six and a half years since then? Does not say yes or no in English—as far as what he’s accumulated of our language. Not yes or no.</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>LQ:</strong> So that speaks to the insularity of the culture.</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>BJB:</strong> <i>Yeah</i>. And the resistance—“because I’m a Cuban.” And my question is, as an outsider—Marco Polo to Kublai Khan—is “what Cuban? What does that mean? When you wear the Cuban trunks when you’re fighting to win a world championship for Cuba, which Cuba? Because the Cuba that produced you is the one that you abandoned, along with your family and culture and all of that. So what do you mean? What does it mean if I parse that?”</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>LQ:</strong> You mentioned in your memoir that while you were in Madrid you lived in a transvestite brothel between the Prado Museum and the Atocha train station. And first, I mean, that’s an interesting nexus, because you have this road leading out of Madrid, right? And then you have this huge emblem of what Spanish culture is to be defined as.  I was wondering how, going to Havana from Madrid after having been at the Prado and the Reina Sofia, you dealt with this celebration of Spanish culture in very frank terms and then seeing its colonial legacy in Cuba.</span></p><p class=\"p7\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span class=\"s1\"><i><img alt=\"\" class=\" aligncenter\" height=\"794\" src=\"https://www.mtholyoke.edu/~nigro20e/classweb/thirdofmaycopy1.jpg\" width=\"1048\"/>Francisco de Goya, The Third of May (1808).</i></span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>BJB:</strong> I mean, Goya’s my favorite artist.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>LQ:</strong> And there’s a lot of Goya in your writing.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>BJB:</strong> Well, I think that a lot of what I try to do that is travel writing is like that—you know, Goya had the Napoleonic Wars. Which is interesting because of all of the places that Napoleon traveled to, what’s the place that caught him? Spain. The pride of Spain. Spain was defeated, but they refused to be defeated in a conventional way. That’s where guerilla warfare gets its name. Goya was sitting there on the sidelines, watching some parts of it but imagining a lot of others. But I was very struck, because I’m very fascinated by Napoleon also. And when you think of his pride, the pride of being French—even though he’s Corsican and spoke French with an accent, let’s remember—that kind of patriotism; he goes in there with the Napoleonic code and all that, and they tell him, “You know what? If you think we’re going to love France more than we love our own country and our own values, best of luck.” And five years later Napoleon leaves.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">I see that kind of attitude being the same as when Columbus arrives in Cuba in 1492. “Is it an island?” he asks. “Yeah, it’s an island, the locals tell him.” “Hm. I see a lot of gold around here”—which has no value to the Taíno people—“can you get me some more of it?” “Yeah, sure.” And then they begin to think that he’s sick, because he’s so obsessed with gold. But it’s not good enough that they do this as an act of goodwill. They’re all enslaved. All of them. Then, what? Thirty years later they bring the Africans over, and you have this fascinating triangle of the Ivory Coast to Havana up to the United States. And all the money that was made by Northeastern families. So, is Spain any worse? Every culture on Earth has used some form of slavery or a free labor force to build a flourishing society. America was built on what? The genocide of one people and the enslavement of another. It only flourished after World War Two because there was no industrial competition. And let’s remember that the United States tried to buy Cuba, going back to Thomas Jefferson and offering a lot more money going forward then was offered for Alaska from Russia and the Louisiana Purchase from France. They were always trying to get it, and Spain wouldn’t sell. And then we have this convenient thing, the Spanish-American war, and in all but name the United States owns it.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, the Cuban system is in shambles; it’s not working. But in terms of the chessboard with the United States—Bay of Pigs invasion, [the] Mariel [boatlift], “let the people leave”—it takes almost genius to make worse decisions than American presidents historically have made.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">By Lucas Quatrecasas ’18</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

In mere seconds I am handed a ticket — an old fashioned, receipt-paper square that leaves a slightly chalky residue on my fingers — marked for the film I hadn’t even had time to indicate. His wry smile betrays amusement at the reason he had guessed my order — the string of college-aged customers who had arrived for the same purpose, the 8:30 pm showing of this year’s Cannes Palme d’Or winner.</p><p>Rather than pirating an illicit copy for private viewing like fifth-graders at a sleepover secreting an R-rated movie in a duffel bag, as we might have in another time and place, my friends and I were received at <i>Blue is the Warmest Color</i> without question or controversy. Unlike our Idahoan counterparts, we watched it like any other film, seated amid the sounds of crackling popcorn and commentary from the couple behind us.</p><p>A classroom scene: students crowd around an oblong seminar table, poring over the author’s explanatory key to an intricate text. At one end of the room, latecomers quietly negotiate seating. At the other, two professors gesture toward a stack of volumes. The work in question is <i>Ulysses</i>, the reason for our supplementary after-hours gathering. Eighty years earlier, we would have been hard-pressed to locate even an underground copy of<i> </i>the novel save voyaging to Paris’s Left Bank, but few would give a second look (except perhaps a sympathetic one) to a student reading it on the T today.</p><p><span id=\"more-1261\"></span></p><p>The US court’s 1933 overruling of <i>Ulysses</i>’s obscenity charge formally freed the controversial work of pornographic allegations with the realization that the author’s groundbreaking approach to literary realism was what “led at times to what many think is a too poignant preoccupation with sex in the thoughts of his characters.” This decision seems like a milestone for public awareness of the function of art. That Joyce’s entire objective in <i>Ulysses</i> <i>necessitated</i> the inclusion of sexuality seems more obvious now, but it is a testament to his genius that the novel was so challenging to societal assumptions about what should be acknowledged and what suppressed.</p><p>If Joyce’s sexual descriptions are somewhat veiled by his highly metaphoric prose, there is no question as to whether or not viewers might pick up on the explicit aspects of <i>Blue is the Warmest Color</i>. The inclusion of the most intimate scenes in a relationship between two young French women have set further challenges than <i>Ulysses</i>, testing the progress of the past eighty years in parsing the boundaries between life and art, and the media attention paid these moments out of their context does the film the same injustice suffered by the novel so many years ago. The considerations of the <i>Ulysses</i> case must also be applied here, unless the contentious reactions to the film have occurred for a different reason.</p><p>In 2013, (largely) absent the Puritan values imposed by overt judicial restrictions on the arts, do we attempt to manufacture these boundaries ourselves by encouraging outrage or controversy at cultural objects like <i>Blue is the Warmest Color</i> to make them more exciting, more worth skipping homework for? As we age and grow further from that middle-schooler watching a movie banned by his parents, the adrenaline rush of getting away with something essentially harmless but tantalizingly rebellious seems increasingly elusive. In an era of availability and permissiveness, I sometimes wonder what it would have been like to read <i>Ulysses,</i> or worse, <i>Lolita</i>, illegally and surreptitiously, or gaze with greater wonder at a banned and salacious new film. I’m sure this incarnation of nostalgia is utterly misguided, as it so often is, in its failure to account for the terrible realities of artists living under oppression and censorship — back then and still. It also submits to that simplistic impulse to equate excitement with meaning. So perhaps my point is really the opposite, and I’m expressing gratitude for the freedoms I enjoy today. Is that growing up? But it’s still a little of the other, too — that search for rules to break, even if they’re further under the surface — lest we forget the many reasons we still have to push boundaries, rebel, and engage in some healthy subversion, in art or otherwise.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

It is like we are playing thumb wars but with our feet; mine are on yours, then yours on mine and the grit from the bottom of your feet rubs off onto the tops of mine and I make a face and tell you: <i>You are disgusting,</i> to which you reply: <i>But nothing like you,</i> and round and round we go and now both of us are laughing so hard we can’t even hear the sound of Mom watching the 9 pm news in the sitting room. The curtain is pulled to one side so we can see the sky and we will call our game, this cross between a lover’s dance and thumb wars, “A Dance in the Moonlight”. You start to sing, repeating the phrase over and over again, and I start to sing too, and our voices sound not too different from the way the stray cats do when they fight one another for leftovers when someone has left the trash uncovered, but I will remember this tune, still, when I am twenty-one.</p><p><span id=\"more-1009\"></span></p><p>The Nairobi version of moonshine we call <i>Chang’aa, </i>a cheap brew that is made from fermented sorghum or millet and sold for as little as 20 US cents a cup. It is also known as “Kill me Quick,” because that twenty cent cup could contain, in addition to fermented grain, anything from jet fuel to methanol to crushed antiretroviral medication, “just enough to give it a little kick,” which sometimes translates to, “just enough to strike you blind, or dead.” A man in a YouTube video compares his addiction to <i>Chang’aa </i>to the Devil; he does not understand how or why it is so hard for him to get away. I have never tasted <i>Chang’aa, </i>but I feel like I can identify with Abedi Pele in a way: I have experienced some harmful intoxications of this life. If I could delete seven-thousand miles and two years of our long-distance relationship, I would tell my little sister, the girl with whom I danced in the moonlight, that she should not trust so easily in this world, that people’s cups come with hidden agendas and there are many inebriations in this life to avoid like the plague: you must, for example, run away from untrustworthy men who ask to take you on harmless walks by the river, and block them on Gchat when they try to send instant messages <i>reminding you how</i> <i>special you are</i>. You must flee from the Devil and demand that he get behind you before you cannot get him our of your mind, and now I — I who should be the fun and carefree sister — am at the verge of panic as I compile a list in my head of all of the horrible addictions of this <i>adult</i> life — in alphabetical order for easy reference — in a “How to Have a Heartbreak-Free Life” cheat sheet.</p><p>I am ashamed of how little shame I have over the sheer amount of time that I spent on her boyfriend’s Facebook, all the while crossing my fingers that there should be no accidental “likes,” as I trace out hundreds of connections from his life for a storyline to fill the freezes in the Skype calls between my sister and me. And now I am on my sister’s profile, wondering where she learned how to do her makeup like that in the past two years, and <i>who is the boy with his arm around her and is that a Tusker® bottle behind her shoulder when I’m not even of legal drinking age in this country and does she grind when she goes out to clubs? and —</i> I would laugh if it were not me, at how ancient I feel when she reminds me that I was her less than two years ago.

A throng of white men in frock coats and silk stockings bustles by below, some on their way to a nearby slave auction. There, a line of shackled men stands on a platform, under posters reading “Nègres À Vendre”—“Blacks For Sale.” It’s broad daylight, and my rooftop ledge stands only a few feet off the ground. Yet the men below don’t seem frightened. It’s possible they can’t believe their eyes: Black assassins aren’t quite commonplace in colonial Saint-Domingue. Whatever the reason, their loss is our gain.<span id=\"more-1452\"></span></p><p>A slave driver in a red bandana—our target—leads a chain gang of slaves toward the auction platform. “Animals!” he shouts, in a cartoon villain’s rasp. I release the space bar; Adéwalé leaps into action. He rises like a bird of prey with bulging biceps for wings, drawing his blade midair before crashing down upon his victim like a metric ton of reparations checks. The crowd of planters shrieks. Extracting his machete from the dead man’s body, Adéwalé leaps to his feet—but another treacherous overseer is already coming at him with a cutlass. He knocks the man off balance, circles him on tiptoe, then splits his head open like a melon. A glitch freezes the gruesome animation just as one of the liberated slaves begins to express his gratitude. “You would do the same,” says Adéwalé, “if you could.” The overseer has nothing to add to the conversation—moaning, he hangs in the air like a kebab.</p><p>There’s no denying it: <em>Freedom Cry</em>, like every game in Ubisoft’s <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> series, is as thrilling as it is ridiculous. As Adéwalé, a self-emancipated slave and member of the Assassin Brotherhood, the player sails the Caribbean in a tricked-out former slave ship called the Experto Crede. Assisted by a crew of Maroon rebels and grateful freedmen, you get to infiltrate plantations, dredge up sunken treasure, wrestle sharks, chase down slave ships, and fire broadsides into the splintering hulls of evildoers. Mostly, you get to kill masters with the tools of slavery—because nothing says poetic justice quite like a slave’s machete harvesting a sugar-planter’s neck.</p><p>When Dr. King Schultz shoots the sadistic Calvin Candie at the end of Quentin Tarantino’s <em>Django Unchained</em>, he turns to Django and says, “I’m sorry. I couldn’t resist.” He might as well be speaking for American culture at large: audiences have become fixated on stories of slaves’ revenge. <em>Freedom Cry</em> was released in the same year that <em>Django</em> won an Academy Award, and James McBride’s <em>The Good Lord Bird</em>—a novel about John Brown’s raid on Harpers Ferry—won the National Book Award for fiction. These may be three very different works in three different media, but their success says something about the kind of slavery fictions today’s audiences crave. They want catch-a-fire stories; narratives of master’s comeuppance.</p><p>For some, slave revenge in fiction represents progress. As TheGrio’s Danielle Belton writes in a <a href=\"http://thegrio.com/2012/07/28/slave-revenge-django-unchained-in-film-fantasy-slaves-finally-give-the-master-his-comeuppance/2/#s:jamie-foxx-kerry-washington-django-unchained-comic-con-16x9\">review</a> of <em>Django</em>, “A black historical revenge fantasy means… confront[ing] the ugliness of our origins.” A valid opinion, but one that shouldn’t prevent us from looking into the sometimes troubling origins of these revenge narratives. Specifically, we must recognize that among the first readers craving stories of master’s comeuppance was master himself. The fear of slave rebellion haunts early American literature—not only the forgotten propaganda of slavery’s apologists, but the books of some of the greats. Foremost among these is Herman Mellville’s novella <em>Benito Cereno</em>, the story of a slave mutiny at sea told from the perspective of the “heroic” Captain Delano, who brings it to a bloody end. At the end of the book, Delano addresses the slave ship captain he has rescued, asking “what has cast such a shadow upon you?” “The negro,” he replies.</p><p>Indeed, the shadow of “the negro”—and the masochistic thrill whites found in contemplating it—was the first impetus behind slave revenge fiction. Slave owners and white abolitionists alike believed that slavery (and the presence of Black people in the United States) was an unstable and potentially explosive social contradiction. Slave revenge was the fantasy of its swift resolution—a vision of divine justice for some, an apocalyptic nightmare for others, and largely useless to slaves themselves.</p><p>These are very different times, but it’s hard not to see similar impulses at work in our own slave revenge renaissance. We live in a world that has largely failed to address the legacy of Atlantic slavery, and revenge fantasies offer the clean, cathartic satisfactions of retroactive resolution. History can be a painful thing to contemplate, and going back in time to punish villains is more immediately satisfying than trying to imagine the past on its own terms. Rather than slavery as it might have been, revenge fantasies address themselves to modern guilt or outrage over what the Martiniquan poet Aimé Césaire once called “the atrocious inanity of our reason for being [here].” They have more to do with our own feelings than the lives of the dead. But satisfying as they are, the revenge stories audiences love today have little to do with the real lives of slaves and slave rebels.</p><p>What differentiates slave revenge fantasies from other stories of slave resistance is their emphasis on crime and punishment. They like to linger pornographically on slavery’s horrors, which justify and intensify the pleasures of imagined retribution. At their best, they are premised on the principle that “it is beautiful that sin should exist to be punished.” But in the context of slavery, stories of sin and punishment cannot help but center on masters. No matter how much time Django or Adéwalé spend on screen, they are not really the heroes of their stories. Subordinated to our contemporary desire to fix history, they are reduced to mere instruments of justice. Slavery and slave-owners remain the stars of the show: as Ta-Nehisi Coates <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/01/toward-a-more-badass-history/266997/\">points out</a> in a column on <em>Django</em>: “Slave revenge has the luxury of making slavery primarily about white people.”</p><p>James McBride’s novel <em>The Good Lord Bird</em> is a brilliant subversion of this kind of revenge narrative. Throughout the novel, McBride juxtaposes John Brown’s Quixotic mission to destroy “the infernal institution” with the pragmatic strategies of resistance practiced by the novel’s slave rebels and Underground Railroad conductors. For McBride’s John Brown, slavery is a villain in a morality play. For the slaves, it is a lived reality, something to be dealt with strategically. The gap between the two makes for many of the most interesting moments in the novel. The novel’s narrator—a twelve-year-old boy John Brown frees and christens “Little Onion”—has a sharp sense of the divide between his own interests and those of the zealous abolitionists. At a rally where John Brown is speaking, Onion observes the crowd:</p><p>“They called for them rebels’ heads, announced they’d trounce ‘em, bounce ‘em, kill ‘em, deaden ‘em where they stood… It was like a big, long lynching. Everybody got to make a speech about the Negro but the Negro.”</p><p>As McBride’s novel artfully demonstrates, heroic revenge fantasy tends to upstage the difficulty and complexity of real slave resistance. Adéwalé’s swashbuckling hijinks in <em>Freedom Cry</em> look pretty silly next to the activities of the real slave rebels of the colonial Caribbean—people like Jamaica’s Nanny or Haïti’s François Mackandal. The game’s Maroons look silly, too. Bland freedom-fighters with anachronistic liberal values, they are nothing like the colorful guerrillas of Caribbean history, who allied with native peoples, practiced military magic, and fought to create traditional African societies in the hills of the New World. They had better things to do than punish their former masters.</p><p>To give credit where credit is due, <em>Freedom Cry</em> is the first game set in the colonial Caribbean that doesn’t erase slavery altogether—as have twenty years of titles like <em>Pirates</em>, <em>Empire Total War</em>, <em>Age of Empires III</em>, <em>Colonization</em>, and <em>Port Royale.</em> But its fixation on comeuppance—on slavery as a morality play—is a serious limitation. Revenge, in art as in life, is too easy. It’s a way of sidestepping the hard imaginative work necessary to bring historical characters and worlds to life. Slave resistors weren’t puppets in the hands of our modern outrage, but real people making difficult decisions in an uncertain world. Some of them rose up in arms, and others ran away. Some of them turned to traditional African religion, while others re-invented Christianity, appropriating it for their own purposes. Some of them fought to end slavery once and for all, while others—like Jamaica’s Maroons—made treaties with their former masters.</p><p>Expecting games to demonstrate this level of nuance might seem farfetched. But many games—especially RPGs and historical strategy games—already do. One of the things that makes games so special is their capacity to simulate difficult choices, the kind you have to make without knowing what happens next. A game that really brought the world of rebel slaves to life would confront players with some of these choices—and their consequences. For all its good qualities, <em>Freedom Cry</em> doesn’t offer such an experience. But it’s too early to count out the genre entirely. Beyond revenge, games might yet have something to contribute to the way slavery is imagined and remembered.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Previously relegated to the dark, climate-controlled labyrinths below universities, federal buildings and private collections, the archive has emerged into daylight. The repositories of the everyday now interact directly with the everyday, to unusual effect.<span id=\"more-1443\"></span></p><p>In the <em>New York Times</em>, Nick Bilton describes the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/10/fashion/on-social-media-memories-linger-after-a-breakup.html?_r=0\">difficulty of erasing memories</a> that have been documented on social media. “Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other sites are happy to lure you to post every intricate moment of your relationships online. Yet when things go wrong, these social tombs do nothing to help people easily delete those memories.” In <em>The Atlantic</em> Julie Buntin shares her <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/shes-still-dying-on-facebook/373904/\">obsession with her deceased friend Lea’s Facebook profile</a>. Her painful account charts the decline of Lea’s emotional and physical health through the statuses and pictures she posted online. And in the <em>New Yorker</em>, Adam Gopnik has <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/07/stones-and-bones\">criticized the 9/11 Memorial Museum</a> as a space “luridly profuse in its documentary imagery….”</p><p>Each of these pieces registers the influence of digital records on the increasingly unsettling relationship between us, our memories, and the dead. In a world that saves our photos, thoughts, and communications automatically, the things we leave behind have an ever greater tendency to rub up against us. It has become increasingly difficult to bury the past, which frustratingly, eerily, keeps getting folded over the present like pizza dough.</p><p>We love and value the archive. It allows us to piece together and interpret fragments of the past, and recast them as keys to the future. The archive is systematic: it shows us that reality is organized, and that we can make sense of life (at least, in retrospect). We fetishize the archive. When stepping into a frigid room, full of boxes that haven’t been touched by human hands in decades, we feel powerful: we have a secret, a life that will now open up to us as vividly as the yellowed letters and photographs allow. The archive holds an important position in our cultural imagination. For those of us who have never personally sifted through John Keats’s love letters, we experience the soothing and tantalizing nature of the archive through books, movies, and museums.</p><p>But it is the imagined distance of the archive that makes these sensations possible in the first place. The archive has to be far away. We imagine it underground, impeccably clean, and perfectly ordered in long corridors of metal filing cabinets. Too much contact with an archive can feel strange. To be alive among so much dead matter can be uncanny. In <em>Cronos</em>, Guillermo del Toro’s (emphatically unsexy) vampire film, the ailing villain Dieter de la Guardia possesses the archive of an alchemist who, centuries ago, attained eternal life. The creepiest scenes in the film take place in Dieter’s archive-cum-bedroom: an austere and sterile storehouse for dead secrets and the man’s grotesque, cadaverous form. Meanwhile, the protagonist, who has accidentally injected himself with the elixir of life, becomes a bloodthirsty vampire who, though appearing younger and stronger, also shows signs of decomposition. His skin burns in sunlight, and peels off like leaves of yellowed paper. Underneath, his new hide is the color of alabaster. As an undead, he is not ended — and yet, he must sleep in a chest in the attic like a forgotten thing.</p><p>Today, the archive is uncomfortably close. In a hyperbolic flourish, I would like to claim that many of us, documentarians and curators of our own lives, have reached the status of the undead. Like zombies, we pop up in each other’s news feeds and Instagrams. Bilton notes in his article that when he does a Google Image search of ”Nick Bilton,” his ex-wife, by some magical algorithm, pops up. He worries about what relatives and future girlfriends will see when they look at his profile, and laments that Facebook makes it frustratingly hard to get rid of unwanted memories: hundreds of photos and messages must be deleted one at a time. In her article, Buntin writes that since Lea’s biological death, “she’s died again and again…. Facebook has made her death a sort of high-concept horror movie. How many more times will I grieve her? How many more details from my past, from Lea’s past, are buried online, waiting for me to uncover them?” Buntin goes on to describe Lea’s wall, which has turned into a virtual memorial. There is something uncanny about the similarities between communicating to and remembering a friend on Facebook. Social media enacts a leveling process between the living and the dead.</p><p>We face these issues on a grander scale as well. Gopnik observes in “Stones and Bones” that memorial museums exist for the purpose of discovery, preservation, and learning. Holocaust museums, for instance, make public memories that have been rescued from obscurity. In so doing, they “memorialize the dead without becoming macabre.” “What happened on 9/11,” he continues, “by contrast, was a crime deliberately committed in open air as a nightmarish publicity stunt, one already as well documented as any incident in history. We can’t relearn it; we can only relive it.” There is nothing to uncover or piece together. The trauma of the event simply repeats itself: photographs, phone calls, pieces of twisted metal.</p><p>The emergence of the archive isn’t necessarily a bad thing—my allusions to the undead are meant to amuse as much as alarm—but this phenomenon is one we must address. We now live in what Foucault described as “the epoch of juxtaposition, the epoch of the near and far, of the side-by-side, of the dispersed.” We no longer live in the world as beings following trajectories; rather, we live in an ever-blossoming network in which the people and places we engage with constantly overlap. Now that overlapping temporalities and modes of being have emerged, we must come up with new ways to cope, to bury, because the way we humanize the dead speaks volumes about the way we live in the world.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Due to the helicopters that never stop circling and a ubiquitous network of loudspeakers, these festivals take on an almost refugee camp quality, and festivalgoers, in the tradition of their predecessors, almost universally leave caked in mud, sweat, and ink (that “festival chic” remains such a catchphrase is beyond me). The mythos of that summer haunts the dusty avenues of today’s festivals, from the impossible lines of vehicles clogging the highway entrances to the sunburnt Lolitas wearing flower crowns and white dresses that hang off the bone. There are even ghosts. A few hours after the campground opened in Tennessee, I looked out the window of my car to see a few overall-clad ladies in their fifties, asking passing cars for shrooms and muttering something about California.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">When choosing a name and a punchy opening for her title essay, Didion consulted Yeats. “The Second Coming,” written almost a half-century before, prophecizes apocalypse and rebirth—a fitting, if not overly heroic characterization of the struggle faced by the grubby juvenile runaways she spent her days observing in San Francisco. It was only a year after her essay’s publication that this crowd, along with their East Coast partners-in-peace, would slouch towards Bethel, a small rural community forty some miles southwest of the town of Woodstock, where the event was originally scheduled to take place. Didion never wrote on Woodstock—at the time, she was busy meeting with Linda Kasabian, a member of the Manson “family,” at the Sybil Brand Institute for Women to discuss the recent murders—but I chose Didion’s essays to take along as a source of either nostalgia or smarm (according to necessity) for the trip down to Tennessee.  I wanted to see how the much-hyped Bonnaroo—an amalgam of the French <i>bon </i>and <i>rue</i> that means “the best on the streets”—measured up to the summer of love, the emergency summer, or whatever you call that rosy age that today’s teenagers lovingly tribute with jorts.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Say what you will about the pastoral charm of every festival’s choice to take place on a farm, but I found Bonnaroo to be a particularly improbable experiment. Woodstock, at least, was nestled in the artistic throes of southeast New York State, not too far from a city bustling with progressive ideas. Bonnaroo is something else altogether. It’s not the Bible Belt, but driving the length of Illinois will do wonders for anyone who would call the redneck an endangered species. On the way down, I noticed two enormous aluminum crosses, one “JESUS IS LORD &lt;3” finger-painted in dust on the business end of a semi, and maybe five sets of signs bearing odes to the automatic weapon:</span></p><p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rel=\"text-align:center;\"><span class=\"s1\">THUGS WON’T STOP</span></p><p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rel=\"text-align:center;\"><span class=\"s1\">FOR A COP</span></p><p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rel=\"text-align:center;\"><span class=\"s1\">GUNS MAKE SENSE</span></p><p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align:center;\" rel=\"text-align:center;\"><span class=\"s1\">FOR SELF-DEFENSE</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This all stops at the festival gates. To enter Bonnaroo is to travel from the whiskey-fed heartland into anarchy—but only in the best sense. One of the first things to strike you is the sheer size of such an enterprise; over these four days, Bonnaroo becomes the fifth-largest city in Tennessee. When Woodstock’s security director, Wes Pomeroy, grew uneasy about the gross numbers of entrants back in ‘68, he warned, “anybody who tries to come here is crazy…Sullivan county is a great big parking lot.” It’s the same deal here. Apart from the surrealism of its inhabitants—there were, I think, ten or more reincarnations of Jesus himself wandering the festival at any given time—this is a real city, complete with infrastructure and a town square (called Centeroo), yet curiously devoid of laws. Weed, acid, molly are consumed in the open and obtained from either one’s tent city neighbors or grasshoppers in tie-dye shirts that bounce in and out of crowds muttering, “molly” or “coke.”</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At one point, a circle of kids nearby was passing around a pipe made from deer antler, when a few deputy sheriffs approached. The girl with the hot potato lowered it down next to her thigh. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“We already seen ya,” a deputy chuckled. Pipe girl looked nervous, so the deputy kneeled down. “It’s okay,” he said, “we jus’ wanted to see what y’all would do if we sat down next to you while you blew one up.” Pipe girl is still nervous. “What’s a matter, girl?” the deputy comforted her. “It’s okay, you’re in Centeroo.”</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">These are Tennessee deputy sheriffs, armed with twang and pistol, encouraging a group of kids to smoke up. It’s not only the cops who hail from America’s breadbasket, either; in the five or so days I spent at Bonnaroo, I did not meet anyone from California or New England. A freckle-faced blonde girl wearing a military shirt behind me in the line for a port-a-potty cheerfully announced to the line that she’d done molly the previous day, to which a Pinterest board come alive behind her responded that she planned on trying LSD that night. “I’m excited,” she said, knowing that no one would stop her. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The freedom is disarming, but what’s heartening is, it all works somehow. Amid the swarm of critics who chimed in with their two cents in the days after Woodstock, one New York Times op-ed, even after condemning the festival and its attendees’ lack of responsibility, admitted that “the great bulk of the freakish-looking intruders behaved astonishingly well, considering the disappointments and discomforts they encountered. They showed that there is real good under their fantastic exteriors, if it can just be aroused to some better purpose than the pursuit of LSD.” The general consensus seemed to be that any physical discomfort incurred by the rain, mud, heat, and hunger only contributed to the sense of community, release, and mutual nurture by which people would remember it. Climbing over the torn-down fences and baking in the Tennessee heat, festivalgoers of today buy into a similar fiction of cleanliness and peace. Sealed with a dirty high-five, it’s <i>I’m okay, you’re okay</i> here.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In four days, the closest thing to a foil I found was a drooling-drunk kid who’d pissed himself, staggering around Raoul Duke style with a beer in each hand. “You’re bitches,” he growled through clenched teeth to whoever would listen, beers sloshing onto unlucky laps. No one seemed particularly bothered, though—it takes a lot more to shatter the illusion. “That’s what he was saying?” my friend said later. “I thought he was asking for directions.”</span></p><p class=\"p3\">So where are all the plastic hippies today? It doesn’t take a witch hunt.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Today, the plastics seem to have taken shape in the throngs of young girls who’ve adopted “festival chic” as their mantra. Cutoffs, flower crowns, and all things “tribal” (however vague and politically incorrect) are apparently the new amphetamines, perhaps with the exception of Ritalin, which is still <i>en vogue</i>. They do not stick out like a sore thumb; in fact, most female festivalgoers ascribe to the same trends in some measure, myself included, and who can say how many of them are as adventurous with substances as my port-a-potty companions. Still, there’s something about their manifestly nostalgic attire—once subversive, now trendy—that demands skepticism. Whether to be skeptical of the crowd or of the festival as a modern enterprise, though, seems to be the question (perhaps even skeptical of their sweat glands, since many of them strike me as amphibian in their invulnerability to the same heat that rendered me a disheveled ball of entropy).</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It invites the kind of derision you might expect from anyone who elevates Woodstock as a revolutionary cultural experiment that existed free from artifice. Here are thirty thousand or so young girls—an army—who’ve all found that eclectic top in that hole-in-the-wall vintage store. This army is not the all-girl battalion you’re dreaming of, either; the guys are just as guilty of the fabulous-little-top thing, bonus points for floral patterns. They dare you to call yourself unique, and they do it in white Converse sneakers, a uniform. What’s more, there are a million ways to charge your phone here, which means a constant stream of photos to Instagram, Facebook, and tumblr, some even containing that pesky buzzword, “festival chic.” These people invite you to wonder: if what they’re wearing is now mainstream, is this festival mainstream, and should you even be using the word mainstream. But most of all, their presence, both physical and digital, forces you to revisit the question of authenticity. Once a spectacle, always a spectacle, but this time the spectacle is documenting itself, not merely there to be documented. Maybe the Hells Angels fiasco at Altamont was not actually the anti-Woodstock—maybe this is.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">No mud, no kinship, these people are <i>clean</i>. They throw rocks at the illusion even as they attempt to bolster it.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is the crowd that gets you down. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But they’ve always been there, if in Haight-Ashbury, then so too in the age of the selfie. And they’re not always so easy to categorize, as Didion herself seems to have believed. Your inclination is to call these girls and these festivals sad shadows of their ancestors, to say that Woodstock was like good acid—pure, guileless, impossible, brave. We put big money on authenticity today, even as we struggle to define it, and more ink than is stored in all the vintage typewriters in America has been spilt on condemnations of our generation as selfish, the generation of the “selfie” itself, the descendants of Narcissus, only we turn drowning into a Sharknado-themed pool party. And it’s partially warranted—our generation certainly has the most finely tuned sense of smell to weed out the hip from the square, the weed from the <i>weed</i>, and it’s not simple anymore—it is anticipating the new, the subversive, before it seems like time. It’s wearing a shirt with “Forgive Kanye” scribbled on in sharpie, rather than one with “Fuck Kanye.” It is a never-ending cycle of embracing the outskirts of taste and then discarding it as mainstream culture. It is irony, and the irony of irony, and then authenticity again. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But to wear the rose-colored glasses so often found on those who would glorify the 1960s is to blindly exclusivize our generation as one of narcissism, kitsch, nostalgia, and artifice where nuance exists. Kids haven’t changed that much, and neither have their modes of catharsis, self-expression, or so-called individuality. Even Woodstock wasn’t innocent; Bob Dylan turned down the gig because he couldn’t stand the large scale, highly marketed nature of the event, a corruption of earlier private jam sessions he enjoyed in the Woodstock area years before. Kanye may be shouting, “If you’re a fan of me, you’re a fan of yourself,” but Jack White is still there to tell his audience, “I’m not here to floor you, I’m here with you.” These kids may seek it out more desperately, but the festival is still a place to defy rules, to break free, to surprise people, to move together.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Which brings me to Sterling.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sterling wore a bucket hat with a string under the chin and he had a lot of freckles. I don’t actually know if his name is Sterling; when my friend asked him for his name, what he actually said was, “You can call me Sterling.”</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I must have offended Sterling’s sensibilities, because the first thing he did was grab my waist and force it back and forth. “You gotta move your hips more,” he said, all glassy-eyed. He proceeded to do this three more times without permission. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sterling was trying to get rid of some acid. My friend asked him a question I didn’t hear, and I heard from behind me the same old answer you would’ve thought had grown sour in people’s mouths:</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“That’s why we’re all here, isn’t it? To live life?” he paused for a minute, revising. “Or at least to escape it.”<br>\r\n</span><span class=\"s1\"><br>\r\nA couple hours outside of Nashville, I saw a sign for a town named Sterling. I looked up the name later—it means “genuine”, or “high quality.”</span></p><p class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\r\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\r\n\r\n</p><br>",

The show is Stravinsky’s <i>L’Histoire du Soldat,</i> and I am the Princess. I spend the first half of the hour-long performance sitting profile to the audience, my back resting against the stage-left wall, my face wearing a pout fit for a paralyzed princess. I remain woefully comatose until a dashing young soldier arrives to rouse me with his fiddle.</p><p>With my body at rest, my eyes roam freely about the theater. Sometimes I watch the show that unfolds before me, the very show I will soon enter, whose plot I will complicate, whose characters I will confront. Sometimes I watch Stravinsky’s music swim about the theater, over the balcony, between seats, upward towards the impossibly high, arched ceiling. Sometimes I watch the audience and relish in the inversion of spectatorship: <i>Who is the performer now?</i> I silently dare them.</p><p><span id=\"more-439\"></span></p><p>The theater’s architecture provides endless fodder for distraction. I study the curled wooden planks that snake along the walls, allegedly built for acoustics but more decorative than functional. My eyes follow their path, skimming familiar faces in the foreground. They travel to the ceiling and fixate on the microphone that hangs above the stage, attached by two diagonally opposed wires. They travel to the empty seats on the balcony inscribed with innumerable names of alumni, illegible from the stage. They travel to the exit doors, aisles, elliptical railings: the theater is a labyrinth for my restless pupils.</p><p>With my vision occupied, my mind roams freely. Or, rather, my mind strays predictably to the choreography that I am about to perform. The benefits of visualizing success have been researched in countless studies. Sitting onstage in nervous anticipation, I subscribe avidly, if only as an amateur, to their findings. Though my eyes are directed at the “Devil,” my character’s antagonist, I do not see her gesturing wickedly; I see myself dancing in her place. Though my tune of the “Pastorale” enters my ears, I do not hear its mournful melody; I hear the “Tango” that will soon arouse me from my slumber and incite my torso to fall in line with the drum’s deep rhythm. Though my body is placed in a seated posture, I do not feel erect; I sense my body dip and rebound as it will when the drum sounds.</p><p>I return my eyes to the stage:<br/>\nThe Soldier beats the Devil at cards, intoxicates him into oblivion, and slides him off the stage. The narrator encourages him, “Now, take back your own again!” and the septet begins to play. My heart knows this line; this is its cue to begin to palpitate.</p><p>By the time I rise to dance, I have already performed a one-woman show—a royally pouting, still-bodied, roaming-eyed, mentally-rehearsing, heart-quaking circus act. A one-woman show whose turn-out was embarrassingly low. Just me and you, in crummy seats, for a half-hour performance that couldn’t position itself on the right side of the curtain.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

		"body" : "<p><em>In February, Advocate member Alex Wells sat down with Australian writer John Hughes and recorded the following interview.</em><em> Part I is published here: stay tuned for Part II. You can find John Hughes’s work published in the Advocate’s latest issue, </em>Origin.</p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/eichorn-photo-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"Eichorn Photo 1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-692\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/eichorn-photo-1.jpg?w=670\"/></a></p><p> </p><p>Alex Wells: <i>The two stories you’ve given us for the </i>Origin<i> issue come from your newest book, The Garden of Sorrows,</i> <i>a collection of reverse animal fables that will be published by University of Western Australia Publishing later this year</i>. <i>How did the idea for this project come about?</i></p><p> </p><p>John Hughes: The idea had been with me for quite some time. Largely, I think, it came about during the period when I was working on a couple of my earlier books, from experiences working in foreign countries where I wasn’t terribly familiar with the languages. I found that what I began to notice in places where lots of people gather are the things we don’t usually notice when we understand the language, that is, the whole range of nonverbal communication that goes on between people. And it struck me that when I was doing this, what I was looking at was a series of different kinds of animal behavior, really. (I don’t mean to put myself outside that: my own was a kind of animal behavior as well, being more predatory, or at least observing the others.) And so it made me start thinking for some reason about how close to animals we really still are—because basically we are animals, aren’t we? So that got me thinking about fables and the way that animals have been used to tell stories, simple stories with a kind of moral, and then I began thinking about the metamorphosis and the classical tradition of transformation.</p><p>What I’m giving you here is a cluster of things, and eventually they all sort of came together in terms of thinking: well, given our Antipodean context here, it might actually be quite interesting to turn the metamorphosis around in a way and so to start with animals—but animals which have already distinctly human qualities. To start with animals, but Australian animals, which aren’t romanticized at all—they’re not cute and cuddly and they’re mean and nasty animals in many instances—and to present these animals in dramatic situations and to look at the transformation, but this time with animals turning into human beings.</p><p><span id=\"more-746\"></span><!--more--><!--more--></p><p> </p><p>AJBW<i>: What work is Australia specifically in </i>The Garden of Sorrows<i>—and in particular native fauna, which is indigenous here in a way that Australians descended from immigrants are not</i>?<i> In what way is it an Australian work, if at all?</i></p><p> </p><p>JJH: Well, again I suppose there are a couple things there. The first one is that this is <i>my </i>place, the place where I was born and where I have grown up, so the landscape and those particular animals are things I’ve either experienced directly or have been part of the mythology or the stories of this place.</p><p>But I think, secondly, it just seemed to me that Australia was such an appropriate place. In <i>The Garden of Sorrows</i> I’m thinking about Eden, in some ways, a sort of paradise—and the garden that seems to be at the start of certain mythologies and storytelling traditions—and again, because Australia is such a dry, desert-like place, it struck me that this is a different way of thinking about a garden. A garden, but much more barren, or primeval, or perhaps even a perverse sort of paradise. Or an inverted sort of paradise—so, in this paradise, sorrow reigns supreme rather than the innocence that’s there in the Christian tradition.</p><p>So I think it comes of the nature of this place, and because that seemed to present me with certain possibilities where I could examine European myths and theologies but in a topsy-turvy setting—that appealed to me very much. Using Australian animals, many of which are known now outside of Australia but usually known because they’re cute or strange or whatever else, I could play around with both local knowledge and international knowledge and also play around with the kinds of assumptions that exist about these creatures. And use those assumptions to my own ends.</p><p> </p><p><i>AJBW: The theme for this issue is </i>Origin<i>, and among the submissions we’re publishing there is predictably much talk of travel and of homeland—and your interest in the garden fits in well, here—but we’ve also found a recurring interrogation of ideas about authorship and originality among the pieces. How would you say your story engages with these two issues, or with the theme more broadly?</i></p><p> </p><p>JJH: Well, yes, <i>Origin</i> as you say is the garden, so there’s a sense of the beginnings of human life, and trying to look at—in stripped-back or simplified form—some of the key problems and dilemmas that have long plagued us in terms of human social interactions, morality, those kinds of things.</p><p>One of the other ways of thinking about <i>Origin</i> in terms of these stories is that because, as I said, I’m using a number of stories from particularly Greek myth, which certainly are there behind much of Western literature—so for me, I’m going back to a lot of these stories and putting them in a landscape and a place where it might at first seem there isn’t a very strong connection at all. And perhaps we might then say, if we’re thinking about what makes a story original or the origins of a story more generally, I think there is a certain number of stories that are available that we can tell. And everything else is a variation: what we’re continuing to do is to write variations on these.</p><p>So for me, one of the things that was very stimulating to my imagination and to the way the stories developed was the sense of planting something foreign on this soil and seeing what would come of it. And I suppose if there’s anything original in them it’s in that bringing together of two things that probably haven’t been brought together in this way before. It’s that sense, I suppose, of making new these ideas and stories that pre-exist us, so that the reader is aware and there’s this echo: they sort of carry the trace of their origins but hopefully they are also making something which is unfamiliar as well.</p><p> </p><p><i>AJBW: Your title set me thinking at first about Borges and his </i>Garden of Forked Paths<i>, and this talk of stories already being written reminds me of the imaginary inaccessible tomes in that collection. Let’s talk about influence, something I know is important to your earlier work and which has come up here again. As a quote-unquote historical college magazine, the Advocate has a long tradition of writers—and especially poets—who feel very strongly the weight of tradition upon them. Harold Bloom talks about the “anxiety of influence,” with a special attention to the way young poets work to forge their own clear imaginative space. You wrote poetry as an undergraduate, and I wonder if the anxiety or forced creativity with respect to inheritance has been a concern of yours even since you were young. And also whether the mixture of fiction and non-fiction you are writing now allows different modes of response to the anxiety of influence than, say, poetry would have.</i></p><p> </p><p>JJH: I don’t know whether this is partially to do with growing up in Australia—and perhaps some sense of feeling outside the mainstream, or at least the mainstream of both the American literary tradition and the European one—but I think there’s a freedom that comes from the sense of anonymity. A part of you thinks no one really cares what you write anyway; there’s such a small audience here that in some ways it doesn’t really matter—and I’m not saying all Australian writers feel like that but I’m thinking about myself in this instance.</p><p>So that’s one level, but I think also because of my Ukrainian background, I’ve always felt a very strong connection from the early days to Russian or Central European literature. And there, too, I feel like an outsider, because I haven’t grown up in those places, I’m not writing in those languages, and I’m still writing from over here—that has given me a strong sense of freedom, because I feel like I can sort of claim these people as part of my heritage while at the same time being outside that heritage. So in a way, I haven’t really felt a weight of anxiety in terms of the people I might claim as being my influences: it’s more that I feel I can develop a very individual relationship to them. So I found that to be quite liberating, and I can have a lot of fun with it.</p><p>In terms of what you were saying about this working in a sort of borderland between fiction and non-fiction, it’s something I enjoy playing on, certainly in <i>Someone Else</i> and in my other works as well. If we think about borderlands geographically, as well, they’re the most interesting places in a lot of ways—obviously they can also be quite dangerous places, and they can be places where there’s a lot of desperation, a lot of tragedy and pathos as well—but at the same time these are places that have marked the boundaries between cultures, between different kinds of geography and history and whatever it might be. So I think the borderland between genres is particularly resonant as well.</p><p>And I feel that maybe this is the other thing to do with me being both over here, so growing up in this place and feeling already isolated and slightly homeless, but also feeling an attachment to a culture which is twelve thousand miles away, although I think of it as mine. I can have a sense of irreverence, or if not irreverence then a feeling that I can pick the bits I like and play around with them while ignoring the others, and I don’t feel as if I’m committing some kind of sacrilege. So I guess that feeling of not quite being at home in either place hasn’t meant that I feel like I haven’t got a heritage or a tradition—because in a lot of ways, literature is borderless, we can grow up in this place and we can read Shakespeare and Tolstoy and Melville and we can still make things of these writers—it’s more that my attachment to it much more oblique or harder to specify than I imagine it is for young American writers who are growing up in America, or young English writers who are growing up in England, or young French writers who are growing up in France.</p><p> </p><p><i>AJBW: Still, though, you are born into an Australian tradition of sorts, aren’t you? Which is still a tradition, although it likes to efface itself and is often self-deprecating. The sculptor Robert Klippel is the only Australian who makes it into your cast of characters in </i>Someone Else<i>. Do you see yourself as part of an Australian literary tradition, in any sense, and do you feel the shadow of older Australian writers hanging over your work?</i></p><p> </p><p>JJH: I don’t, no. And that’s not to say that I don’t read Australian authors and like Australian authors, because I do, but I don’t really see myself and my work within whatever those traditions might be. Maybe this is something that might appear later in the development of a literary history of this place as well—that the sorts of things I’m doing may well appear to be part of something going on—but I don’t feel consciously to be part of any tradition or to be in any real dialog with that tradition.</p><p>One thing I was conscious of in writing the stories in <i>The Garden of Sorrows</i> was that I didn’t want them to seen in any way as being pastiches of Aboriginal dreamtime stories or those sorts of stories. There’s a danger I think for an Australian writer when you start telling stories about animals, and using the landscape, they might be seen in some way as totemic or as borrowing some kind of indigenous storytelling more. And I wasn’t trying to do that at all—not because I don’t that that’s an interesting and powerful literary mode, because I do, but because it’s completely alien to me and I certainly wouldn’t want to be assuming that right or that voice. It’s not the reason for doing it, but like I was saying to you before, although the stories are concerned with Australian animals, the stories themselves have their origins in Europe and elsewhere rather than here.</p><p> </p><p><i>AJBW: The Advocate, as you know, is a college magazine, and we are proud to have published what one Pegasus once called “the juvenilia of the great.” Some recent expeditions into our archives have seen us dig up the early poetry of Wallace Stevens, T.S. Eliot, Adrienne Rich and more. We also are proud to have published—and to continue to publish—the juvenilia of the mediocre. What do you think when you look back at your own early work? </i></p><p> </p><p>JJH: I try as hard as I can not to: I almost studiously avoid it. But at the book launch for <i>The Remnants</i> last year, the person who launched the book, Mark Mordue, was the editor of the student magazine at Newcastle University when I was studying there, and Mark published what I think were my first publications. They were very long poems under the influence of the mad Cantos of Ezra Pound—I’d been reading quite a lot of Pound in an American Lit. course, and I think it appealed to the worst sides of my sensibility and of my writing as well. So Mark, after that launch, reminded me of this, and he rather mischievously had some copies of these things that he forced me and others who went out to dinner afterwards to look at. And it’s funny because I’d almost forgotten that I’d done those things, so on one level it was really quite strange because it was like reading the work of someone else, someone I felt very little connection to whatsoever—and it didn’t bring back for me that person, I couldn’t get back into the mind of that person, I couldn’t really remember, almost, having written those things.</p><p>Also, I think, I am particularly obsessive about my work, and if you look at my books, things that appear in one sort of pop up in the next one as well. And this whole business I was talking about before, of taking something and putting it in a different context, and I think with taking something from one book and putting it somewhere else, strange things happen there as well. So for my own psychological health I just have to leave things behind and forget about them, because otherwise I think if I were to return to them I’d be obsessed by them in the end—so especially once something’s been published, I try not to return to it again.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

It’s a strange space that is frequently ignored: its function as a gallery is overridden by its main function as Mather’s lobby. The space’s weirdness is dulled by the routine of the hundreds of students who walk through it every day.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Recognizing the gallery’s transitory nature, artist Matthew Terry and Harvard senior Kevin Hong decided to employ materials (gauze, paper, wire, rope, wood) that would engage ideas of transience and permanence, transparency and opacity. Collaborating with nine students, and adopting Thomas Hirschhorn’s motto, Energy: <i>Yes! </i>Quality: No!, several works were created that respond to the unique qualities of the gallery itself: its open airspace, its whiteness, its pock-marked columns, its concreteness. One’s experience of the installation will change on a daily basis as atmospheric conditions affect the look and feel of the materials.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/photo-1-12.jpg\"><img alt=\"photo 1 (12)\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1584\" height=\"899\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/photo-1-12.jpg?w=670&amp;h=899\" width=\"670\"/></a></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The atmosphere was very relaxed and playful, and because all who attended came in at </span>different times, the process simply started and brought people into the mix sequentially as they showed up. Several people had to leave early but made both tangible and important contributions while they were there. The success was in the ability to ‘curate as we go’ … in essence, directing traffic, setting up simple and varied conceptual premises, while still leaving room for accident, and student input in the process.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The execution was driven by a philosophy of direct action and process, as a way to make art </span>happen with speed. With a three hour time limit the installation was brought to a reasonable point of completion, and simply stopped there. It becomes a sort of game, a series of ‘moves’ made in response to the previous ‘move’ or action. The intention, beyond obvious safety concerns, was not to limit this action in any way. This first pass exposed the rich potential of this method.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It may be that this initial installation/ workshop ends up looking a bit self consciously ‘artsy’ yet it </span>is merely the byproduct of a group of individuals at play with materials in an experimentation where nothing was ever, in fact, ‘off limits’. Someone decided to make a “nest”, others, working on the idea of building ‘from the inside out’, made a sort of rib cage and skin, a heart. Other people explored ideas about line or repetitive action as a means to an end. There is a self organizing principle here at work, enhanced by the choices and editing of everyone involved. That is how overall cohesive strength was achieved at the end of the working period.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/photo-3-10.jpg\"><img alt=\"photo 3 (10)\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1586\" height=\"899\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/photo-3-10.jpg?w=670&amp;h=899\" width=\"670\"/></a></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Consider the space, the architectural features of the 3 Columns gallery at Mather House. </span>It has three tall columns at its center, reaching from floor to ceiling. Two are 48″ wide and at right angles to each other, and the third is set in relation to these at an angle, in a Y formation. The third column is 5 1/2 feet wide, and sits about that far away from the two other columns. The space and solid partition in balance to each other. It seems intentionally designed to respond to human traffic and movement. All three columns are 10″ thick, and a horizontal groove in these, defines the transition between floors, top and bottom.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A set of circular stairs wraps around the space up to the balcony and upper level. </span>The space is large and open in feel, and large plate glass windows invite the outside in. Trees exist in and out of an enclosed space. At different times of day and night, light washes through the space or casts shadows. Over any stretch of time, the space seems alive, in tune with the cycle of day and night, the seasons and the weather, an integral part of a man made urban ecosystem.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">All of Mather shares this specific feel, born from the work of architects and builders in the 70s. </span>It is as if the infrastructure and the gallery itself, invite the play of light, space and form. Mather build is an adaptation to this reality, expanding its reach in direct response to its intended function, as an art gallery and entrance into the core of the house.</p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Things to look for: </span></em></p><p class=\"p1\">Veiled and hidden from direct view is the germ of an idea, and it’s symbolic Icon as an incandescent light bulb. Red string for it’s filament and the connective circuitry of the brain, copper wire as the threaded end, paper indicating the glass bulb.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/photo-4-6.jpg\"><img alt=\"photo 4 (6)\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1587\" height=\"899\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/photo-4-6.jpg?w=670&amp;h=899\" width=\"670\"/></a></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hidden also is a single black line, disguised as a shadow, slicing the architecture. </span><span class=\"s1\">A response to the overt presence of a red line, parachute cord stretched over two pieces of </span>wood.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/photo-5-5.jpg\"><img alt=\"photo 5 (5)\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1588\" height=\"899\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/photo-5-5.jpg?w=670&amp;h=899\" width=\"670\"/></a></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A rib cage, skin and a disembodied heart, a nest, somehow find their place incorporated into </span>the architecture of a dream.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/1000008403.jpg\"><img alt=\"1000008403\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1583\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/1000008403.jpg?w=670\"/></a></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A ghost wall seems to challenge the materiality of what stands behind it, but also acts as a </span>window opening, a veil on solid reality.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/photo-2-11.jpg\"><img alt=\"photo 2 (11)\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1585\" height=\"899\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/photo-2-11.jpg?w=670&amp;h=899\" width=\"670\"/></a></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Wood frames echo the woodwork of a Japanese tea house, or the ends of a scroll, a curve of </span>gauze is part dream catcher, part light net. Absorbing and amplifying the natural and artificial light in ways that o solid surface could never achieve.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A soft geometry is born out of the simple act of hanging, fastening, folding a curve into being. </span>The built in curvature of large rolled paper survives the repeated cuts of a razor blade, leaving a vertical wave in answer to the flat static wall behind it.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/1000008381.jpg\"><img alt=\"1000008381\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1581\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/1000008381.jpg?w=670\"/></a></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The play of vertical and horizontal, transparent and opaque, line and contour is everywhere. </span>These “art values” or formal elements of composition, scale, weight, proportion all come into play in a self organizing principle of call and response, a first move, leads to iteration. <span class=\"s1\">Repetition drives a point home, and singularity is able to provide a focal point. </span>The power of this transformation is owed to the fact that the installation incorporates the support. If we understand the canvas here is the original architecture, then every accident of concrete casting, perforations, grooves, and the space itself come into play. The changing light and the movement of the viewer, enveloped in this environment and yet able to see it from a distance becomes a matter of participation.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/1000008399.jpg\"><img alt=\"1000008399\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1582\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/1000008399.jpg?w=670\"/></a></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There is opportunity here for a less passive experience. A chance to meet the art and the space </span>where it is displayed with one’s own thoughts and feelings. In a sense, to complete the work by reading into it, and imagining further action and possibility. To spend time in contemplation, to come again and see it with new eyes is our invitation.</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>The installation will be in place for the remainder of February.

In the summer, friends sometimes take my hands and lay them across their face and neck like a cool cloth. My mother tells me I will be this way until menopause&mdash;something to look forward to.</p>\r\n<p>I collected heating pads as a child. Not out of anything as dramatic as medical necessity, but simply because warmth is charming for one who is perpetually cold. I had the whole array&mdash;the plug-in electric, the microwavable beanbag, the hot water bottle. My particular hot water bottle was red, heart-shaped, and had grooves down the front that made a pleasant rubbery sound when strummed. I would carry it around the house like a toy tucked under my arm.</p>\r\n<p><span id=\"more-288\"></span></p>\r\n<p>Once, when I wanted to skip school, I swallowed a mouthful of hot water and pressed the bottle to my forehead until I was hot to my mother’s touch. It was convincing&mdash;too convincing&mdash;and she wondered whether I needed to be taken to the doctor because of the unusually high reading on the thermometer. It was only at my urging that she let me get into bed and watch movies on the tiny television brought up from the kitchen.</p>\r\n<p>When she brought soup to my bedside that afternoon, she commented that I didn’t seem so hot anymore and offered to take my temperature. I ran off to the bathroom for my hot water bottle, pushed the grooves against my skin, and hurried back to her to prove my illness. She puzzled over my forehead and asked what I had done to it. I can still see her face change as she recognized the striations across my face as the inverse of the bottle in a comical series of portraits. I was caught.</p>\r\n<p>I don’t remember the punishment; the reel runs out before I’ve even confessed. I’d gotten my day off. That’s what I remember. I don’t remember what my hands felt like, but they were probably warm for once&mdash;from clutching the bottle and the excitement of lying. I imagine that the blood flushed outwards to my fingertips and cheeks and stayed there, at least for a little while, because sometimes the best cure is the simple pleasure of being sick.</p>\r\n<div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\r\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\r\n<div class=\"u\">\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"u\">\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\r\n</div>",

Fiction editor Patrick Lauppe ’13 describes our vision for this theme below. </em></p><p>Fever is the only madness that most of us will ever experience. Normally, we are well-groomed and coherent; we dutifully channel our physical and mental drippings to the appropriate drainage receptacle. But in fever, we allow our duties to slide without shame. We proudly bathe in our own fluids, now emerging. We bask in <i>our</i> mess, <i>our</i> grime. We commit everything to the page, gibber whatever bubbles up at whomever is around to hear, even if it is only ourselves. The censor who usually edits our interjections for the world’s eyes and ears has called in sick. Now the truly subversive, the destructive, the half-formed, and the superfluous are all part of the discourse. And it is good.</p><p>Fever is as bacchanalian as it is solipsistic. It is the mind’s last hurrah before either death or recovery, the difference between which has narrowed. We pursue it in hallucination and intoxication, but fever must arrive uninvited: a devil that can cross any threshold he’d like. Fever is a nightmarish house party that leaves the body ravaged and scarred from the inside out. From the outside, fever is never pretty. Fortunately, for the feverish, nothing is ever outside.</p><p>Fever often walks on small feet, leaving behind bloody prints. External worlds fall to its conquest as swiftly as internal worlds swell. The feverish is also the viral, the bubonic. The endgame. It is therefore also the leveler, the carnival of horrors that rolls into town without fanfare.</p><p>For this theme, we expect to read about feverish dreams haunted by inflamed beasts, transfigured nights without sleep, novels written by the hour, streams-of-consciousness set to boil, and bodies bursting at the seams. We expect to see quarantines and extinctions, self-propagation and self-destruction, ramblings and diagnoses, bodies revolting and minds being set free. Perhaps we may make out a light at the end of the tunnel; but even this may be an illusion that fever only projects.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

How would you say your story engages with these two issues, or with the theme more broadly?</i></p><p>JJH: Well, yes, <i>Origin</i> as you say is the garden, so there’s a sense of the beginnings of human life, and trying to look at—in stripped-back or simplified form—some of the key problems and dilemmas that have long plagued us in terms of human social interactions, morality, those kinds of things.</p><p>One of the other ways of thinking about <i>Origin</i> in terms of these stories is that because, as I said, I’m using a number of stories from particularly Greek myth, which certainly are there behind much of Western literature—so for me, I’m going back to a lot of these stories and putting them in a landscape and a place where it might at first seem there isn’t a very strong connection at all. And perhaps we might then say, if we’re thinking about what makes a story original or the origins of a story more generally, I think there is a certain number of stories that are available that we can tell. And everything else is a variation: what we’re continuing to do is to write variations on these.</p><p><span id=\"more-678\"></span></p><p>So for me, one of the things that was very stimulating to my imagination and to the way the stories developed was the sense of planting something foreign on this soil and seeing what would come of it. And I suppose if there’s anything original in them it’s in that bringing together of two things that probably haven’t been brought together in this way before. It’s that sense, I suppose, of making new these ideas and stories that pre-exist us, so that the reader is aware and there’s this echo: they sort of carry the trace of their origins but hopefully they are also making something which is unfamiliar as well.</p><p><i>AJBW: </i><i> Let’s talk about influence, something I know is important to your earlier work and which has come up here again. As a quote-unquote historical college magazine, the Advocate has a long tradition of writers—and especially poets—who have felt very strongly the weight of tradition upon them. Harold Bloom talks about this as the “anxiety of influence,” with a special attention to the way young poets work to forge their own clear imaginative space. I know</i><i> you wrote poetry as an undergraduate, and I wonder if anxiety or forced creativity with respect to inheritance has been a concern of yours ever since you were young. And also whether the mixture of fiction and non-fiction you are writing now allows different modes of response to the anxiety of influence than, say, poetry would have.</i></p><p>JJH: I don’t know whether this is partially to do with growing up in Australia—and perhaps some sense of feeling outside the mainstream, or at least the mainstream of both the American literary tradition and the European one—but I think there’s a freedom that comes from the sense of anonymity. A part of you thinks no one really cares what you write anyway; there’s such a small audience here that in some ways it doesn’t really matter—and I’m not saying all Australian writers feel like that but I’m thinking about myself in this instance.</p><p>So that’s one level, but I think also because of my Ukrainian background, I’ve always felt a very strong connection from the early days to Russian or Central European literature. And there, too, I feel like an outsider, because I haven’t grown up in those places, I’m not writing in those languages, and I’m still writing from over here—that has given me a strong sense of freedom, because I feel like I can sort of claim these people as part of my heritage while at the same time being outside that heritage. So in a way, I haven’t really felt a weight of anxiety in terms of the people I might claim as being my influences: it’s more that I feel I can develop a very individual relationship to them. So I found that to be quite liberating, and I can have a lot of fun with it.</p><p>In terms of what you were saying about this working in a sort of borderland between fiction and non-fiction, it’s something I enjoy playing on, certainly in <i>Someone Else</i> and in my other works as well. If we think about borderlands geographically, as well, they’re the most interesting places in a lot of ways—obviously they can also be quite dangerous places, and they can be places where there’s a lot of desperation, a lot of tragedy and pathos as well—but at the same time these are places that have marked the boundaries between cultures, between different kinds of geography and history and whatever it might be. So I think the borderland between genres is particularly resonant as well.</p><p>And I feel that maybe this is the other thing to do with me being both over here, so growing up in this place and feeling already isolated and slightly homeless, but also feeling an attachment to a culture which is twelve thousand miles away, although I think of it as mine. I can have a sense of irreverence, or if not irreverence then a feeling that I can pick the bits I like and play around with them while ignoring the others, and I don’t feel as if I’m committing some kind of sacrilege. So I guess that feeling of not quite being at home in either place hasn’t meant that I feel like I haven’t got a heritage or a tradition—because in a lot of ways, literature is borderless, we can grow up in this place and we can read Shakespeare and Tolstoy and Melville and we can still make things of these writers—it’s more that my attachment to it much more oblique or harder to specify than I imagine it is for young American writers who are growing up in America, or young English writers who are growing up in England, or young French writers who are growing up in France.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

We called the people that came in or out of it “missions” and pretended to spy on them. Anytime we saw someone walk past it we’d shrink behind a bush and watch them. <i>Where’s that mission going?</i>, we’d say. <i>He looks extra suspicious today.</i> The missions would glance back angrily at us. We’d giggle.</p><p><i>It’s so silly</i>, I used to think, <i>because people can’t be missions! </i>In my head I dragged out the words in the way children do when they think they are saying something funny, in the way that almost always makes it unfunny. <i>People</i> can’t be<i> missions! </i></p><p><span id=\"more-1095\"></span></p><p>*</p><p>Playing pretend games, we used to interrupt ourselves and say, <i>Not in the game, I need to go to the bathroom. </i>It was ok, for some reason, to momentarily duck out of whatever fantasy we were inhabiting as long as we preposed it with “not in the game.” That was one of our rules, which were themselves without origin. When we laughed at the missionaries, I’m sure what we really wanted to do was walk up to them and say, <i>Not in the game, what on Earth are you doing? </i>Of course, we didn’t know that they were missionaries, or what missionaries did. We had been raised in atheism, in a secular city, in a world that at least pretends to be post-colonial. In all likelihood our parents had deemed evangelicalism—unlike, it is perhaps worth noting, sex or drugs or death—too much for our little light hearts to understand.</p><p>*</p><p>The Foreign Missions Club was a giant building, institution-like, with rows of windows suggesting uniform rooms. It was surrounded by protective rows of bushes, and had an entrance with a small parking space. Its name was painted across its front in large capital letters. The strangest thing about it was that it was so close to our house, and on a leafy street surrounded by other completely normal, coherent scenes: a two-story house with fancy cars in the driveway; a pair of council estates with people and dogs playing in the courtyard; a church, not much used; a bench where a certain homeless drunk liked to sit and talk to no one. This all made sense, and it bored us. It was what we saw on our way to the park every day. The Foreign Missions Club was also on the way to the park, but every day it was something different.</p><p>Approaching it, scampering along, we would turn and look at each other and say: <i>This could be it.</i> Part of the joke was that one day the missions would turn on us because they had found out that we had been spying on them. What exactly they would do was, like everything else, unclear. The reason why it was funny was that we knew they would never do it. We knew from the way they looked at us when we laughed at them, crouching behind a bush, whispering what I’m sure sounded to them like “missionary” and not “mission,” that we had the one-up. For kids, that was a priceless thrill.</p><p>*</p><p>Years later I came back to find that the Foreign Missions Club had drably rebranded; it was no longer called the Foreign Missions Club, but The Highbury Center. Everything about this was wrong. Highbury is the name of my neighbourhood, and the Foreign Missions Club’s new name therefore appeared to be claiming some kind of relevance, even centrality, within the community. How could that be, though, when everything about the building was bizarre, secretive, incongruous with its surroundings? The other problem was the new name’s neutrality. <i>The Highbury Center</i> could have been anything: a doctor’s clinic, a youth center, an office of the local government.</p><p>What the Foreign Missions Club actually was — what it still is — is a hotel for missionaries. There was a time when evangelical protestant missionary workers could stay there for free; these days they get a discounted price. It was and continues to be advertised as a place of respite for all those who fall on the evangelical spectrum: Christian aid workers, doctors working in mission hospitals, as well as the old-fashioned types whose sole mission is to spread the gospel. A few times I have considered going in to ask a few questions in a friendly, neighbourhood sort of way. But I doubt I’ll ever do it. Our joke with the Foreign Missions Club was always doomed to be a one-sided game.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

In the column reprinted above, the editors do their best to soothe these romantic spirits: it’s not you, they promise—it’s love that’s the problem. A timeless preoccupation, a “favorite” since ancient times, love (they say) is simply impossible to transcribe onto the pages of an undergraduate publication.</p><p><span id=\"more-181\"></span></p><p>The editors explain that love is an intricate and many-sided thing; however, they regret to announce, its best sides have already been taken. And while it is indisputably interesting, love is not contagious: those who remain outside of Cupid’s sway do not care to hear from his arrow-struck victims. Ultimately, the column concludes, a love sonnet simply doesn’t belong in a magazine. Removed from its proper home—a romantic landscape furnished with gentle whispering winds and twinkling stars—the poem loses its power, only to be obscured by crumbs of ash in the hands of some “careless Sophomore.” The editors recommend that their inspired contributors tone down the love bit and just write good poetry.</p><p>The editors of 1866 can relax in their graves; their concerns have been largely obviated by the passing of time. Today’s poetic climate has shifted away from outpourings of love in iambic pentameter, and not too many rosy-cheeked lads remain sulking over their rejected sonnets for Sally. But to reveal how <i>Advocate</i> editors throughout the decades have treated the matter of meritorious love poetry, I leave you with two representative poems: “The Undying” from 1905 and “Poem” from 1955.</p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/the-undying_-1905.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-186\" height=\"461\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/the-undying_-1905.jpg?w=614&amp;h=461\" title=\"_The Undying_ 1905\" width=\"614\"/></a></p><p><em>Published in </em>The Harvard Advocate<em>, Vol. LXXIX, No. 6 (May 12, 1905). </em></p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/poem_-1955.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-187\" height=\"614\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/poem_-1955.jpg?w=461&amp;h=614\" title=\"_Poem_ 1955\" width=\"461\"/></a></p><p><em>Published in</em> The Harvard Advocate<em>, Vol. CXXIX, No. 3 (Christmas 1955). </em></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

The following is an event reflection by Advocate</em> <em>poetry board </em><em>member, Kevin Hong ’15. </em></p><p>“I actually died six weeks ago,” David Ferry said at lunch.</p><p>We were sharing a combination platter at Café Algiers—Ferry, Dan Chiasson, and members of <i>The Harvard Advocate</i>. Ferry explained that his heart had stopped for a minute at a Brookline restaurant before a doctor resuscitated him. Chiasson’s brow furrowed and his eyes softened as Ferry went on: he returned to the restaurant to find out the name of the person who had saved him, and having obtained a name, wrote a “heartrendingly beautiful” letter to the man. (“Longhand?” Chiasson asked, impressed. Ferry is vivacious but admits to his physical frailty.)</p><p>“But they gave me the wrong name!” Ferry said. Chiasson covered his reddening face in his hands and laughed.</p><p>There was a certain warmth between the two poets, arising from years of mutual interest and understanding. Chiasson’s second book, <em>Natural History</em>, is intended to be in dialogue with Ferry’s translations of Horace. Ferry has touted Chiasson’s critical essays, admiring his close attention to both line and sentence. At the reading, Ferry joked, “I’m so glad to finally have the chance to read with my former roommate,” and Chiasson flashed his Amherst College belt.</p><p><span id=\"more-205\"></span></p><p>Remarkable similarities link these men: both went to Amherst, both received graduate degrees at Harvard University, and both taught at Wellesley College (Chiasson is now associate professor there, and Ferry is a professor emeritus). Chiasson published in the <i>Advocate</i> in 2011<sup>,</sup> while Ferry’s poem had appeared in the <em>Advocate</em> back in 1957<sup>.</sup> Both, on Saturday, November 3, rekindled their relationships with 21 South Street.</p><p>Ferry delivered his roommate punch line and Chiasson bent over double. I’ll remember that image. In my mind, David Ferry has acquired the mythic status that his own work explores: Ferry’s brief foray into the underworld echoes Orpheus’s engagement with hell, a frequent subject in Ferry’s most recent book, <em>Bewilderment</em>.</p><p>“I bring no messages from the underworld,” he said at lunch.</p><p>While Ferry’s poetry looks ahead and below into the abyss, Chiasson’s looks back towards his own childhood. Chiasson read from the manuscript of his upcoming book, <em>Bicentennial</em>. The title is taken from the 1976 celebration of America’s birthday, which Chiasson recalls with the cool remove characteristic of his verse. His distant voice is most effective in poems about his father, whom he never knew. The poems are littered with what little knowledge the poet could gather up from his father’s obituaries. In “One on One,” Chiasson reflects on their relationships’ core of absence:</p><p><em>I thought we had agreed to play. I thought you said<br/>\nWe’d play and play all day, beating and being beaten,<br/>\nTaking turns at losing learning its advantages</em></p><p><em>for a young man’s character, then changing fates.<br/>\nWhat kind of game is this, your going away forever,<br/>\nsending word, years later, that you’d died?</em></p><p>Chiasson’s verse creates an absence that belies a repressed bitterness and a nostalgia for things past—for the final absence. The bemused and slightly affected speaker reveals his continual bewilderment. His colloquial tone, through repetition and subtle wordplay, slowly gathers momentum before leaping into a higher emotional register. In “Star Catcher,” Chiasson laments the innocent ecstasy of childhood that is at once wonderful and inane:</p><p><em>The logic of loss, we could all understand:<br/>\nEvery fan trusts that losing is barter.<br/>\nThough we wanted to die when the Yankees won,</em></p><p><em>We knew that all losers eventually win,<br/>\nEvery drowned brother results in another:<br/>\nAs the plane goes, so goes Thurman Munson.</em></p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/dan.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-207\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/dan.jpg?w=670&amp;h=1006\" title=\"Dan\"/></a></p><p>The younger poet’s cool and composed reading is in many ways diametrically opposed to that of Ferry, who followed Chiasson with a group of poems from <em>Bewilderment</em>. Chiasson engaged with his audience with poise and detachment. Ferry’s words are an affective plea for understanding:</p><p><em>Among the living the body can do so sometimes,</em><br/>\n<em>But the mind, constricted, inhibited by its ancestral</em><br/>\n<em>Knowledge of final separation, holds back,</em><br/>\n<em>Unable to complete what it wanted to say.</em></p><p><em>What is your name that I can call you by?</em></p><p>– “Resemblance”</p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/david.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-208\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/david.jpg?w=670&amp;h=714\" title=\"David\"/></a></p><p>Kay Ryan has said that if you put an ice cube on your palm, your palm turns pink because the chill attracts your blood. Poetry functions in the same way: its chill brings a reader’s emotions to the surface. Dan Chiasson may practice these poetics of restraint, but Ferry does not subscribe to the same school. It was clear, as I watched him read, that he was possessed and enlivened by his verse. The poet’s voice was insistent and vigorous. Fear, confusion, and love were made palpable in the poet’s unshakeable lines.</p><p>In <em>Bewilderment</em>, Ferry acknowledges his age and puts his feelers out into the unknown. He probes the spaces between human beings and the void of loss. Like torches in a cave, his lines burn brightly, providing what little light he has in his search for the divine, his confrontation of “the big joke.” And in Ferry there is always room for humor: in “Found Single-line Poems,” he inserts the subtitle, “Playing With My Self.”</p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/dandavid1.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-216\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/dandavid1.jpg?w=670&amp;h=476\" title=\"DanDavid\"/></a></p><p>I left the building last Saturday invigorated and a little dazed by these two very different poets from two generations: one looking back and one looking beyond, one cool and one warm, one who references his childhood as a lost time, and one who invokes classical mythology to recover lost time. Dan Chiasson and David Ferry, after the reading, did agree on one notion evoked in Ferry’s poem, “Brunswick, Maine, Early Winter, 2000″:</p><p>“It is a connoisseurship of the word;<br/>\nPhilology is that venerable art</p><p>That asks one thing above all other things:<br/>\nRead slowly, slowly. It is a goldsmith’s art,</p><p>Looking before and after, cautiously;<br/>\nConsidering; reconsidering;</p><p>Studying with delicate eyes and fingers;<br/>\nIt does not easily get anything done.”</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

I wanted a blue protractor and a green compass but I had to pick one so green it would have to be. Not a lime green and not an olive but some strange middle ground, like an unripe banana or maybe a bay leaf.</p><p>They were on the required supplies list, and though we rarely used them in math class I was always sketching circles on the scrap paper from my mother’s office. I started off shaky, and the hinge on the compass was a little loose, so even when I steadied the arc, my circle’s ends would never line up. I was frustrated.</p><p>But eventually I learned to hold it right, to position my fingers and flick my wrist just so, and I started to experiment. Who needed pencils when I could use pens, or squeeze in a crayon after I shaved its edges with scissors? My circles were good, and they were everywhere.</p><p><span id=\"more-950\"></span></p><p>A few years later, in geometry, I was taught the trick to drawing an ellipse. Put two pins in cork board, tie a string between them — leaving slack — and pull with a pen, tracing around both. It’s because the sum of the distances between a point on the ellipse and its two foci is always constant, they said. It’s magic, I thought.</p><p>This was more fun than the circles. I bought a cork board and did it at home.</p><p>I found that as I brought my foci closer the ellipse would move toward its ideal self, the circle. From the misshapen amorphous thing to perfect radial symmetry. I liked that. I liked how even shapes acknowledged the worth of closeness.</p><p>And as they moved apart it became more and more difficult to draw the ellipse around them, because it was hard to keep the string above the pushpins, and it left me only with a few ugly, unconnected scratches. Once the sum of the distances between the foci equaled the length of the string it was all over — all I had was a point, closer to one focus, maybe, than the other, forgetting what it was to be an ellipse, forgetting how that felt, what it meant. The foci were naked, then. Where were their shells?</p><p>I forgot about the compass. I was getting older, and I forgot about the compass. I’m about to graduate and I’m scared but I forgot about the compass. I can draw the circle without two foci. Less fun, certainly, but I can draw the circle alone.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">♠</p><p>It was late and we sat by the water. It was late and it was warm, with a warmth that betrayed its lateness. There were two lampposts, ten feet apart, maybe. I said I wish I had a long rope and a piece of chalk. You said excuse me. I said I’d tie each end to a post and trace an ellipse along the concrete, there, by the water, there, in the warmth. You said it wouldn’t work. I didn’t try.</p><p>There we were, you holding my hand or me holding yours, next to each other but ten feet apart. I couldn’t have known it then but that was the moment we decided not to move closer, the moment we decided to stay an ellipse, flatter even than we had been. Maintaining the flatness would hurt, I thought, but it would hurt less than the sharp explosion of a circle, the puncturing of something real and whole. The ellipse would whimper when it split. The circle would scream.</p><p>We went back inside. I to one room and you to another, and I didn’t come find you, and you didn’t come find me, and we didn’t find each other. We wanted to, probably, but we didn’t try.</p><p>I thought about it, you should know. I did think about it.</p><p><em>Illustration by Sam Richman ’15</em></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

France, Spain, Germany, and Italy have historically been dubbing countries, replacing the audio of almost all foreign-language media, while smaller countries like those in Scandinavia have preferred subtitling in most cases. Globally, dubbing is most often used in films for small children, and as of late, in all blockbuster films. </span><span id=\"more-1677\"></span></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align:left;\" rel=\"text-align:left;\"><span class=\"s1\">Thus, in much of East Asia, Latin America, and French-speaking Canada, moviegoers often have the choice of watching a film in its original language with subtitles or a dubbed version created for their region. Television, on the other hand, can often go either way. This situation is further complicated by the advent of standardized forms of languages like French and Spanish that are meant to render foreign films comprehensible and inoffensive to a large public. The result has been the rise of <em>dubbese</em>,¹</span><span class=\"s1\"> a stilted and uncomfortable language used in dubs that lacks the richness of idiomatic expression. There’s a good amount of scholarship on <em>dubbese</em>, citing various examples of unidiomatic dubs from different time periods, but here I’ll take as an example the opening <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i3eujee0pc%2523t=128\"><span class=\"s3\">scene</span></a> from 2010‘s The Social Network. After tolerating the fictional Mark Zuckerberg’s condescending monologue about final clubs, his girlfriend, Erica Albright breaks up with him. Before walking out on him, she drops the following line:</span></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align:left;\" rel=\"text-align:left;\"><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">“OK, you are probably going to be a very successful computer person. But you’re going to go through life thinking that girls don’t like you ‘cause you’re a nerd. And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won’t be true. It will be because you’re an asshole.”</span></p><p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"407\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/_i3eUjeE0Pc?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"670\"></iframe></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> But in the Latin American Spanish dub of <i>The Social Network</i>, Erica’s devastating remark in this scene is distorted. Her dubbed lines, if spoken in English, would sound something like the following. “OK, it’s probable that you will be a very successful person in information technology. But you’re going to go through life thinking that girls don’t find you attractive because you are a genius. And I only want you to know that I believe that this is not true. In reality, you are a big idiot.”</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Not only does Erica’s tone become troublingly bureaucratic in the dubbed version, she actually seems to be saying something different. To begin with, the disparaging quality of Erica’s calling Mark a “computer person” isn’t captured by the translation. Then “nerd” is translated as “genius”—a quality that the original text doesn’t imply about Mark—and the deep sarcasm of the phrase “from the bottom of my heart” is totally lost. Ultimately, Erica’s affirmation that Mark is an “asshole” becomes a something else entirely. She instead calls him “a big idiot,” which not only lacks the moral and characteristic dimensions of the word “asshole” but doesn’t even seem that insulting, especially after she’s just called him a genius. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> A less confusing but equally deformative shift happens in the Latin American Spanish dub of Brad Pitt’s “scalps” <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dv56tkc2jo%2523t=43\"><span class=\"s3\">monologue</span></a> from <i>Inglorious Basterds</i>. Here’s the English: “Now I don’t know ‘bout y’all, but I sure as <i>hell</i> didn’t come down from the goddamn smokey mountains, cross five thousand mile o’ water, fight my way through half of Sicily, and jump out of a <i>fuckin</i>’ aeroplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity. Nazi ain’t got no humanity.”</span></p><p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"407\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/SF-iGTocZPA?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"670\"></iframe></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> This is what the Latin American dub might sound like in English: “Now, I don’t know about you, but I did not come down from Tennessee from the damned mountains, cross an 8,000 kilometer ocean, battle while traveling through half of Sicily, and after that, jump out of a damned plane, to teach Nazis humanity. The Nazis don’t have humanity.” Here as above the contempt and aggression of the original monologue (not to mention Pitt’s intensely Southern accent) are forgotten in favor of intelligibility.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> The Spanish language does not lack good equivalents to English words like <i>asshole</i> or the adjectival use of <i>fuck</i>. In fact, the problem might be that there are indeed <i>too</i> many ways to say these things in Spanish. Snowflake-like, no two region’s insults or profanities are ever exactly the same. One region of Spanish-speakers may use a word for asshole that is unfamiliar, benign, anachronistic, or even radically offensive for viewers in another region, causing unforetold boredom or panic if heard in a dub. When dubs are supposed to be placidly understood by a broad range of Spanish-speakers, regional or possibly distasteful vocab is a no-go. Thus, many language-neutral dubs are forced into insufferable blandness. Even worse is that, in trying to make characters speak inoffensively, the subtleties and flavor of the original dialogue are obliterated. Heated exchanges become tame conversations; witty rejoinders become absurd remarks. The characters begin to sound like exactly what they are—a bunch of people in a small, dark, soundproofed roof reading lines off a sheet of paper.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> But boring international languages exist for a good reason. Largely, their purpose is to avoid scandals. The problem is that in trying to offend no one, one is often polite to a fault. As the narrator of Ernesto Sabato’s <i>El Túnel</i>, the artist Juan Pablo Castel, remarks, “He praised my paintings in such a way that I understood that he hated them.”</span></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align:left;\" rel=\"text-align:left;\"><span class=\"s1\">Read Part One <a href=\"http://theharvardadvocate.com/blog/post/2015-2-18-distortion-the-problem-of-dubbing-in-int/\" title=\"Distortion: The Problem of Dubbing in International Cinema – Part One\">here.</a></span></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align:left;\" rel=\"text-align:left;\">Read Part Three <a href=\"http://theharvardadvocate.com/blog/post/2015-4-8-distortion-the-problem-of-dubbing-in-inte/\" title=\"DISTORTION: The Problem of Dubbing in International Cinema–Part Three\">here.</a></p><p class=\"p3\"><em>by Lucas Quatrecasas ’16</em></p><p class=\"p3\">¹ <span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">Scholars in French translation call this language “</span><i>le</i> <i>synchronien”</i></p><p class=\"p3\">² <span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">I think the Metropolitan French dub of this scene is far better than the Latin American Spanish dub.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">³ <span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">This is not always the case, however.

The person opens the wrapping paper and says, excitedly, “Oh, what’s this?” And you say: “It’s a collection that reimagines famous stories from the perspective of female characters.” And then, to give it a little weight, to prove its not merely a gimmick, you give a quick list of Rivka Galchen’s accomplishments: One novel, <em>Atmospheric Disturbances</em> (2008), excellent reviews; professorship at Columbia; one of the <em>New Yorker’s </em>20 under 40 (2010). <em>Et voila:</em> the gift-receiver is thrilled about their new book.<span id=\"more-1434\"></span></p><p>Galchen’s realm of exploration in <em>American Innovations</em> is women’s subjectivity, that vast and uncharted planet. In all the stories she plays with—Gogol’s “The Nose,” Bolaño’s “Last Evenings on Earth,” Thurber’s “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,” and so on—women do not feature, or feature only as props, supporting actors, background noise. Galchen takes these stories and twists them, relocating them both geographically—mostly to the U.S., and often to Oklahoma, where the author grew up—as well as psychologically, setting them deep within their female narrators’ minds, which are invariably strange and unsettling landscapes. Mental instability and self-delusion are recurring motifs (it will not surprise the reader that Galchen has an M.D. in psychiatry). Indeed, one of the main triggers of this self-delusion is the struggle to appear sane. “I’m a pretty normal woman, maybe even an extremely normal one… A normal, stable adult with an ordinary life,” asserts the narrator of “Once an Empire,” comically unconvincing. Later on in that story, the narrator’s beloved possessions (“I love my things. I have a great capacity for love, I think”) spring to life and parade out of her apartment, never to return.</p><p>Galchen’s protagonists are strange women living in an arguably stranger world. Their relationship with reality is troubled. In the first story, “The Lost Order,” a woman semi-intentionally takes the take-out order of a confused customer who thinks he is calling a restaurant. “I hate my phone,” the narrator grumbles, following the call. “I hate all phones.” Alone in her apartment, she is connected to the outside world and only through her phone, which she grows to despise.</p><p>Weight loss is a common theme. The second sentence of the collection is: “I was trying to eat a little less often, it’s true.” One gets the sense that, like the reader of the stories Galchen references, the women protagonists in <em>American Innovations</em> are used to viewing themselves from the outside. “I would see us from the outside and recognize that I was, in an old-fashioned and maybe even demeaning way, the sidekick, the mascot, the decoration; it was thrilling,” admits the narrator in “The Region of Unlikeness.” Yet often, their reaction to the image of themselves is a desire to make themselves smaller.</p><p>Fittingly, <em>American Innovations </em>is a slim volume, and by the end, the reader might find themselves wishing it was longer. As previously mentioned, it would make, in its current hardback form, an excellent gift; however, those who want it for themselves are advised to consider waiting for the paperback, or trying a library.</p><p> </p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Film Still: 00:58:00.</em></p><p>Stargazing on a summer night, a friend once told me to identify planets as I would the moon. They are the ones that don’t twinkle. Rather than producing their own light, they shine flat light reflected from the sun. And by the time that light reaches us, it is minutes to hours old. These celestial bodies, as we perceive them, are not self-defining, nor are they ever our precise contemporaries. But we just see isolated, presently glowing dots.</p><p>What happens when humans are put into this position, made into reflective surfaces that claim foreign light as their own, masking its historical origin? In an extreme case, we get the events of <i>The Shining</i>, Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 psychological-horror movie based on a Steven King novel by the same name.</p><p><span id=\"more-1100\"></span></p><p>In the movie, the titular concept of shining is explained as a form of telepathy between certain people and places. Danny Tarrance, a child whose father (Jack) agrees to be winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, has “the shine”: he can communicate with others telepathically, and he regularly receives visions and information from Tony, the “little boy who lives inside his mouth.” As a child, he’s naturally impressionable, and because of Tony, who takes shine and plants it directly in his head, he’s especially receptive to outside influence.</p><p>The main source of that influence is the Overlook Hotel, which converts shining from mere telepathy into a complete infiltration of characters’ identities. The Overlook does not just present the past; it inserts it into inhabitants’ present ideological states of mind. The Overlook is permeated with the histories of individuals (like the Grady family members, psychotically murderous and brutally murdered) and of the collective (like those celebrating at the Fourth of July ball that Jack finds himself a part of).</p><p>But the significance of the shine is not that it exists, nor that it scares people. Rather, it’s important because of how it affects Jack, who embraces it to the point that he becomes it. While the Overlook shows Danny the corpses of potential playmates (the creepy twin girls) and threatens his safety, causing him to retreat into himself in fear, it shows Jack to the warmths of a bar and a ball, welcoming him to do its homicidal bidding. His environment absorbs him into its history, and he brings the Overlook’s history into his family’s reality. All of time becomes compressed, and Jack’s immediate present as caretaker becomes his historical and future reality. He has always been the caretaker of the Overlook and he will be for ever and ever and ever. But only because the structure around him has its particular past, and because Jack is such a reflective surface for its shine. With Jack to carry on its legacy, the shine itself barely matters anymore. Especially not to Jack’s wife, Wendy, who can’t even see the shine early enough to attribute Jack’s behavior to it, and cares only that she and Danny are about to be murdered.</p><p>Which brings us back to the original point. There is a phenomenon I like to refer to as the Cultural Shining. It’s the process by which an individual — perhaps parallel to Jack in his adoption of the shine — shapes her cultural identity around nostalgia for times she has accessed through artistic fragments, but never actually experienced. Passion for the past becomes inspiration, and new creation comes out of it, making a never-ending chain of decontextualized shine. Yes, this is how we achieve artistic conversation across time, and it’s gorgeous. But even more interesting are the decapitated allusions that arise when a Wendy comes along, unaware of sources and their contexts, which become inconsequential. It amazes me that when this occurs, a reference that arose as a pure shaving of time, summoned to stir its source’s substance into that of a new creation, is so easily drained of meaning. It is freed from the very grips of history that made it interesting enough for someone to adopt it.</p><p>Kubrick understood the intrigue of a referent-less reference; some of the most iconic scenes are also the most ambiguous. The point at which Jack cracked. Torrents of blood pouring from the elevators. The woman in room 237. And these are the horrors, the uncertainties, that keep me awake on a sunlit night.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

		"body" : "<p><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/hemingway.jpg\"><img alt=\"hemingway\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1488\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/hemingway.jpg?w=472&h=315\" width=\"472\"></a></p><p>There are few things to do in Anacostia, Maryland, besides visit the home of Frederick Douglass. It’s an estate called Cedar Hill, a large, white, red-gabled colonial with the type of rocking chair-laden porch that begs you to sit down with an iced tea and a bowl of strawberries. The tour guide looks like a cross between a university librarian and a park ranger; he has sinewy but muscular arms and Frederick Douglass-era glasses, shiny round lenses that hover about his face like flat moons. He is, or at least pretends to be, thoroughly excited about the rug on which Douglass gave his grandchildren piggyback rides, and the cabinet in which his servants served pies.<span id=\"more-1484\"></span></p><p>In the dining room, the tour guide holds up each piece of sterling silver and China kitchenware: “This was the fork Frederick Douglass ate with, this is the cup Frederick Douglass drank from, this is the knife with which he spread his butter…”</p><p>The tour, like most tours of writers’ houses I have been on, has the essence of E-bay sales of Paris Hilton’s old pillowcases, paparazzi crooning “<em>Who </em>are you wearing?” as they finger the brocade hems of stars’ dresses on the red carpet.</p><p>It seems strange that literary figures can evoke that type of reverence when literary culture so often sets itself up in direct contrast to popular culture, the higher arts condemning the very pillars of materialism, superficiality, and anti-intellectualism on which celebrity worship rests.</p><p>Yet hours after scorning Douglass’s kitchenware, I am engaged deep in the bowels of the Internet with an investigation of less culinary but equally superficial aspects of David Foster Wallace’s personal life. I had stepped off the path of his fictional work into a forest of <em>Paris Review </em>interviews and <em>Guardian </em>articles about suicide, addiction, and, as I discovered that night, a tumultuous love life.</p><p>What concerned me that night was David Foster Wallace’s relationship with Mary Karr, a poet and confessional memoirist. The <em>Paris Review </em>“Art of Memoir” interview of Mary Karr introduces the two writers’ romance before mentioning Karr’s seminal work, <em>The Liars Club.</em></p><p>I learn that Mary Karr and David Foster Wallace met in rehab in the early nineties. I learn that David Foster Wallace had a tattoo of Karr’s name on his arm and once called her father to ask his permission to marry her. I learn, in a <em>Slate.com </em>article significantly trashier than the <em>Paris Review </em>piece, that their relationship was “destructive.” I learn that, Wallace sent a letter to the head of his halfway house apologizing for considering buying a gun to murder Karr’s soon-to-be-divorced husband (a document uncovered by D.T. Max and summarized, Buzzfeed-ized, and most-likely libel-ized in a <em>Rolling Stone </em>article titled “Six Things You Didn’t Know about David Foster Wallace). I read a poem by Karr about Wallace’s death called “Suicide’s Note” that contains the line, “you asked/ that I breathe into your lungs like the soprano in the opera/ I loved so my ghost might inhabit you.”</p><p>On the same night, I read a crueler meditation on Wallace’s death in the form of Bret Easton Ellis’s April 2012 tweets. <em>Vanity Fair labels </em>the tweets, in which BEE calls DFW “insufferable,” “needy”, “overrated,” and “lusting for a kind of awful greatness,” a “one-sided duke-out between Brett Easton Ellis and the ghost of David Foster Wallace.” Gerald Howard, who worked with both writers, provides analysis in an interview with the <em>Upworthy-</em>esque title “I Know Why Bret Easton Ellis Hates David Foster Wallace.”</p><p>Later, I finish the last few essays in <em>A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again, </em>and read several Mary Karr poems. Neither my critical nor emotional understanding of the pieces is enhanced by these newfound facts.</p><p>David Foster Wallace has written his own meditation on celebrity fascination, an essay titled “How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart,” about his tennis idol’s auto-biography, <em>Beyond Center Court</em>. In it, Wallace theorizes “top athletes are compelling because they embody the comparison-based achievement we Americans revere—fast<em>est, </em>strong<em>est</em>—and because they do so in a totally unambiguous way.” The desire to immerse oneself in the personal life of a sports celebrity via biography and interview comes from a deeper wish to “know how it feels, inside, to be both beautiful and best.”</p><p>But the fascination with literary celebrities seems to be of an entirely different sort. We do not seek to know what was going on in Hemingway’s mind when he won the Nobel Prize for Literature, but what was going on in his mind while he slowly drunk himself to death on the streets of Pamplona and Paris, what was going on in his mind when he placed a shotgun in his mouth. We are fascinated by Fitzgerald’s destructive (no quotation marks there) marriage with Zelda, Lord Byron’s bisexual promiscuity. Though the writers we revere might be the best in their genres, we obsess over the failings of their personal lives—their addictions, their extramarital affairs and unhealthy relationships, their suicides.</p><p>In this way, the fascination with literary celebrity also differs from the fascination with popular celebrity—the catchphrase of the latter being “They’re just like us!” Paris Hilton’s old pillowcases are sold on E-bay because someone actually wants to use them, maybe to somehow absorb her essence through her dandruff. <em>People </em>readers want to dress like celebrities and be like celebrities, or else they want the celebrities to fall to their level (paparazzi seek out underwear revealed in limo exits and flabby beach bodies). When a celebrity does something worse than undergo a wardrobe disaster or party too hard, she often fades into the background like a once-beloved uncle no longer mentioned at Thanksgiving dinners. Comebacks are possible, but they must be triumphs.</p><p>Writers, as they slip into debauchery, often only garner our favor. Last September, a nonfiction book called <em>The Trip to Echo Spring: On Writers and Drinking</em>, profiled six famous literary figures and alcoholics: Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Williams, Berryman, Cheever, and Carver. It is a popular belief, even, that writers derive their genius from their addictions and their mental illnesses; the Lost Generation’s alcoholism, Woolf’s depression, even the Beatle’s experiments with LSD are said to have been essential to the production of their art. Proponents of this belief tend to ignore that Fitzgerald struggled to finish novels when most debilitated by alcohol, and that the famously straight-laced George Saunders—a trained geophysicist who describes himself in a <em>GQ </em>profile as “a pretty nice guy”– produces some of the best fiction today.</p><p>Perhaps the association of illness and tragedy with genius, and the subsequent obsession with the personal illnesses and tragedies of literary celebrities, comes from the Romantic conflation of poetic inspiration with madness, the type of spontaneity that can be produced by sudden mood swings or drug-induced highs.</p><p>But this alone does not explain the fascination with literary celebrity. If David Foster Wallace’s depression and addiction was only seen as a necessary condition for the genius of his work, why read about his depression and addiction rather than read his work itself?</p><p>Reading is usually lauded for the escape it provides from the mundanity of daily life, but this escape is often one into danger and tragedy. In Anacostia I lean against the bare walls of the gift shop, rereading the passage in <em>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass </em>where Douglass overpowers the brutal slave-master who tries to tie his legs together; the page reflects on the tour guide’s lenses as he explains to my father how to back out of the parking lot for the third time.</p><p>The escapism of reading is a way for us to experience the thrill of danger and the heart-pangs of tragedy without the grief and the repercussions and the physical pain. For us to climb the whole emotional scale of life while our greatest ecstasy is a sip of coffee and our greatest pain is losing the page.</p><p>Perhaps our obsession with the tragedy of real literary figures is an extension of that; a desire to experience the darkest aspects of the world but only second-handedly, through those who will undergo pain most intensely and convey it back to us most effectively. We want the suffering and scandal that we read about in books to be meaningful, and therefore real, but not so real as to enter our own lives.</p><p>I close the page about Karr and Wallace and turn off the bedside lamp. The lights of suburban D.C. shine through the windows of the guest bedroom in my grandparents’ apartment, and I am comfortable and warm. Illness, tragedy, and pain bury themselves below me, not unwelcome monsters under the bed.</p>",

Amis has published numerous novels and collections of non-fiction, including <em>The Rachel Papers</em>, <em>Money</em>, and <em>London Fields</em>. His most recent book, <em>Lionel Asbo: State of England, </em>was released earlier this year. Below is an excerpt from the interview, the entirety of which will be published in the Advocate’s Winter 2013 print issue.</p><p><span id=\"more-126\"></span></p><p><strong>The Harvard Advocate:</strong> Do you have any thoughts about the cultivation of writers? Should it be a collective activity? Should some people not become writers?</p><p><strong>Martin Amis:</strong> Well, it can’t be a cooperative activity. Writing is about solitude. To be a writer you have to not only have an enormous appetite for solitude, but you have to be in some sense most alive when alone. I think that’s why, for instance, dramatic arts is probably much lower-level than fiction and poetry—because it is collaborative. I couldn’t imagine any compromise on having total say. The novelist is in a godlike relation to what he creates. He’s omnipotent, omniscient…he’s autocratic.</p><p><strong>The Harvard Advocate:</strong> Could you talk some more about your thinking process as you begin a novel, its gestation stages, and then how you move from that to the final product?</p><p><strong>Martin Amis:</strong> The key is that a novel has to begin with some strange <i>frisson</i>, a shiver or throb, and you think, ‘This is a novel I can write,’ and you do need to have that—and it’s a very peculiar feeling. And then it can be sort of hardly anything, it could be derisory what this premonitory shiver gives you…Maybe just a situation, maybe just a single character. Then you start writing and see what happens. And usually you have an idea of the beginning, an idea of the end, and an idea of something that happens mid-way through. And that’s probably all you’ve got as you start. So it’s a journey without a map, but with a kind of destination. And then it’s a huge exercise in trial and error and multiple decisions, multiple decisions on every page, until you get close to your kind of platonic ideal of what the novel could have been when it first struck you. But it’s an incremental process. It’s brick upon brick.</p><p><em>Photo courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.martinamisweb.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.martinamisweb.com</a>.</em></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

The last of the six, printed on the last page, rises upward out of the magazine, monumental in form and content.</p><p><span id=\"more-1175\"></span></p><p>The midday sun of the photograph divides the stone into distinct and overlapping geometries, the shadows reaching downward to draw apart granite from sky. In the glare the grain speckles the surface with a constellation of pits and grooves. Three long triangles slice downward, as if above some unseen force has driven stakes deep into the frame. Blunted, tapering columns surge into the remaining space; what they support is unclear. The photographer has composed this shot with care, taking pains to decontextualize the object and revel in its form. Like a photograph of a naked torso, it is difficult to reconstruct a head and legs, though the imagination does so anyway. Narrative pulls back from the subject in the photograph’s framing, giving the viewer nothing more than a sunlit pile of cut stone. The dramatic lighting of the granite surface at the lower left and the interlocking forms at the top of the frame all gesture toward a visual abstraction, and though the slabs are composed of abstract elements, the piece remains grounded, perhaps chained, in its materiality.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"> *</p><p>This photograph, like the five other photographs in the issue, is not identified further than its maker and medium. The list of contents reads, “Hilary Hanson… 32… <i>Photograph</i>,” as if “<i>Photograph</i>” is all that is needed to represent or explain this piece as a work of art. What Hanson might have intended beyond an investigation into geometry and exercise in form is uncertain. And even the sculpted and assembled stones of her photograph appear jumbled, as if a child created Stonehenge from collage. However enigmatic and otherworldly and decontextualized Hanson’s photographic subject appears, this tower of stones places itself closer to the center of experience than a viewer might imagine. It is, in fact, the center.</p><p><i>Omphalos</i>, installed at the heart of Harvard Square in 1985 by former Chair of Harvard’s Visual and Environmental Studies Dimitiri Hadzi, takes its name from the stones that once marked the centers, or navels, of the ancient world. Constructed as a crowning piece of the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority’s “Arts on the Line,” the sculpture marks an effort to “humanize” Boston’s transportation and recast it in the vein of that of Paris or Moscow. <i>Omphalos </i>records a moment heavy with anxieties of American cultural inferiority but also hopeful in urban renewal. That hope, however, seems to have come to an end. An upper section of the twenty-foot sculpture recently deposited a thousand-pound piece of itself onto the sidewalk and the MBTA has slated its destruction for the end of September.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">*</p><p>Hanson’s photograph reveals itself to be, ultimately, an act of mimesis. The camera flattens sculpture and grafts it onto the page. Art creates art. Looking through my own photographs of Harvard from my first fall in Cambridge, I discover that I, too, have taken a picture of <i>Omphalos</i>. Shadow, again, plays over the granite pilasters while the scale of the sculpture is impossible to divine. It is not a particularly striking photograph; it will not make its way into the pages of an arts and letters publication. But its existence informs something of its origin. Perhaps the value of the center of the world between the pavement that splits Mass. Ave. is not so much its artistic merit or ability to “humanize” space, but to find its way into the lenses and pages of those who pass.</p><div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1177\" style=\"width: 680px\"><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dayno-omphalos_2011.jpg\"><img alt=\"Dayno.

A line forms only when we approach the empty, swirling machine: three pale bodies, SPF 70 insured today, guaranteed to wake up tomorrow with flecks of skin peeling off red noses. To find our faces in the crowd, look for one boy with glasses, and another in a black Ché cap. Next to them you will find me, with rounder glasses and a backward, paisley hat.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Last night the domed friend hosted a party for his start-up. He’s the intern. In a room of ten 30-something paunchy Indian men, we ate multiple Chipotle build-your-own-burritos while playing Cards Against Humanity. Several cards required explaining to the company CEO. Until 11pm, we were not the only attendees under twenty-one. There were two others, the CEO’s toddler twins, who tumbled around the party, sucking on closed primary-colored beer cans that might one day make a great #tbt.<span id=\"more-1498\"></span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>With his free hand, the ride operator waves us past the gate into the gondola. His other hand alternates between a few jerky seconds on the control panel, and extended, slow movements of a 24 oz Corona from the pink table to his lips. Under the “Notice to Passengers,” rule #4 states “Persons who are visibly ill or under the influence of drugs or alcohol are not permitted to ride.” Nothing about open containers, so he is free to drink. And nothing about invisibly under the influence of alcohol, either, so we shut the flap that protects us from the ground, and begin the climb.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Squeaks of the pistons run from the soles of my feet to the raised hairs on my neck. In 6<sup>th</sup> grade, a glass elevator rode me up to the top of the Eiffel Tower with green cheeks. My first memory happens to be a dream of me hugging the moon, then slipping away from its crater-ridden embrace, and falling to Earth. I hate waiting in line for roller coasters. This is my first time in a Ferris wheel, making today a day of many firsts.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>First time swinging above the Earth in a circular path, and first time at a NASCAR race.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>At 7 o’clock on the rotation, the track covered in cars rises from the other side of the hill. 343 out of 350 laps have passed in a dull blur of sound. Earplugs stick out of our ears like Martian antennas; we’re all strangers in a strange land. Across the gondola, separated by a white, rusting pole, our host either takes a picture of my sweating face, or a selfie.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Behind him a field of crushed wheat stretches into Sonoma Valley, the host county of the race, known for red wine, not necks. In this field, rows of RV’s sprout and rise into tailgates grilling to a crooning Johnny Cash. One event is fenced in with orange, temporary chicken wire. An American flag drapes over the entrance. On the other side of the divide, three men with goatees, aviators, and beers bathe in an above ground pool.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>From this high up, you can’t see them, or the father and son walking by in matching shirt and cargo shorts, but you can imagine dipping into the warm waters for a moment, close to the ground and on the static, but rotating earth.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>90<sup>o</sup> from the start, and still he snaps pictures. I know because I took pictures of him taking pictures. Below, the cars are as small as some of the people watching. The crowd sits in silence; nobody talks, because any sound that leaves your lips stumbles onto the track and disappears in the roar of 200 mph engines.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Our row, in section 9, is silent like the rest, because no one sits there. We purchased front row seats, advertised as “the fasted on the track!” but also the cheapest in the entire stadium. Closer seats mean more noise means greater likelihood your ears will ring till Tuesday. The fans know this, we didn’t.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>About a 1/8 left to the top, my ankle, finally, stops bobbing up and down faster than the shaking wheel. Intermittent cracks, however, still shut my eyes. Open, and see the line of mobile markets stretching around the rim of the basin. A trailer of official NASCAR merchandise rests without a line next to a deluxe truck dedicated to one driver, Dale Earnhardt Jr. It attracts a clump of men and boys, all in hats with wads of cash tight between their fingers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Earlier, I asked a fan who the most popular driver on the circuit is.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>“Dale.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>“Why?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Pause.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>“Because.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Another pause, then he adds: “Also Danica.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>“Why?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Pause; I complete their thoughts: “because she’s a…”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Giggle.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Dale Earnhardt Jr., son of Sr. (A famous driver who died in the metal grip of his car, after a crash fractured his skull), has won the most popular driver award 11 consecutive times. He has never won a Sprint Cup, NASCAR’s Super Bowl/World Series/Stanley Cup. Jimmie Johnson, 6-time champion, first driver to win AP Male Athlete of the Year (2009), five-time driver of the year, is not on their list, does not have his own merch truck, and few jerseys in the crowd spell out his #48.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Allegiances in a sport where the “Team” is a white male strapped in polyester advertisements in a metal box, are odd. My roommate, at his first race, is most excited about the Dogecoin car, the #98, sponsored by funds raised on Reddit and painted with the cockeyed doge (so humor) on the rear fender to annoy cars and delight fans. Danica Patrick, as the boys acknowledged, is the lone and first female driver in the big leagues, and walks around in lucrative neon green Go Daddy! Ads, when not stripping for American during Super Bowl commercials.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Beside the merchandise, drink stands advertise “fresh lemonade” on one side, and “Spiked Lemonade” next door, separated by one word but flowing from the same citrus source. The lunch line for chicken fingers stretches into the lemonade’s turf, lasting 30-45 minutes, depending on how you push. For my lunch, I went next door, sans line, eating a gourmet lamb sausage with fennel slaw. It arrived split down the middle, on a stale hamburger bun. My friends waited for chicken fingers, and received 3 each, at a rate of $3.33 per finger.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Our gondola slides into the top, jerks to a stop, and we look out from the tallest point in the stadium. Nothing is above our heads, everything sits below, in the cloud of noise and fumes. The track winds in a boot around the basin, .625 miles (1km) per laps. Tag it on Apple Map, and you’re at Infineon Raceway, the official name for the seats watching the cars circle over asphalt, surrounded by stretches of dust. Up here, the distinct features include a Toyota sign, a Toyota Tundra hanging on display (from a crane), and the beige hills rising from the bowl, stretching outward and into green wineries, somewhere in the same county. But no one in attendance faces away from the bowl. Their eyes follow the cars, around and around, completing Δd= 0 as Δt approaches 3 hours, baked at 100 <sup>o </sup>F.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Between the viewers and the drivers, different barriers circle the track, various heights to correspond to the level of risk in a particular section of the curve. At other races (but not today), some turns will turn on a car, and flip the vehicle at the crowd; when that happens, the fence will catch the projectile before it can land in three rows at once.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Back where we should be, one of these chest-high fences separates the viewer from the track. It’s the perfect height to lean on. Everyone practices standing here in front of the front row, arms draped over this chain-link protector, in an act that places part of you on the track. One quick shove, and the entire body could cross the barrier, entering a space reserved for cars and the humans inside them. It’s only a 50-yard dash over a sloped dirt stretch to reach the outer limits. Once parched Earth becomes manicured asphalt, the track will burn the soles of your feet, and at any moment, a car could rip the air around your face, pushing hair away from your skin into splayed disarray. One more step, and maybe you could touch the car itself, feel the thrill of 200 mph beneath your fingers, passing by. From the stands, sight can only approach the need for speed, never moving fast enough to catch a ride.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The time down from the top, I know now, goes by much quicker than the way up. You’ve seen this height before, same angle, just translated a radii or less. When we get back to the bottom and open the gate, the race ends. Someone won, and later, I look up his name. Carl Edwards. The man seated behind us wore his number on his jersey, and on his hat to protect his baldhead, and on his shorts, too. At first we thought he was a scout for Edwards, snooping from the crowd. But then we leaned in closer, picked out pieces of muffled conversation, and learned he was a guest, just like us, plus one giant Aflac duck squawking across his chest.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\r\n\t<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\r\n</p>",

A dried oak wanders outward from the mountain’s negative. Roots snake through cracks. Two stuck stones, starting &amp; staying, have fallen into each other: locked ready to shake off. It was the glacier, Wisconsin, that did it, carving thick braids of sentiment out of quartz. Now it’s another’s move. My arms are ticking. Full of adrenaline and blood, it’s too much for skin to hold, the forearms tendons fingers cable out to grimace the wall and I pendulum over the sheer apex of New York, crossing a crux, splitting I or some part making it out to that face. The bent joint of rock. Exposed and hung out to dry. Sun pools on my back. Bullets of sweat vanish from my head’s crown. There’s nothing to the south of me. All those untouched oaks, sycamore, euphorbia—&amp; underneath huckleberries drop from the bush into lily ponds full of machine-voiced frogs. There’s the dipping lush of earth that begs me to spill into. But nothing holds here. Don’t let me lie. If I could I’d be weatherbeat or in Athens, at the foot of the Parthenon praying. Here’s not enough to stay. Even balance ends, end. I can’t keep my back to it. Face what you see.</p><p><span id=\"more-1519\"></span>***</p><p>Panic near the water—so I’m younger here—no override. I sit on the sideline of the crystalline chlorinate pool. Lifeguard on the far side, father nearer, and the eyes of no one. My eyes expand to take the rectangle in—so it’s a small pool—and swimmers in the foreground slice through evenly. Fast. My breath loses track of itself. Breached &amp; listing. The tiles are blue too but darker—meaning deeper water—and I suck down air. These muscles aren’t mine. I count &amp; try to fake a rhythm, shuddering my own frame. Jolt me into myself. Now my father’s noticed, he flutters down but his voice distorts. Like a blanket laid over my head, muffling with wool the sharpness of me. Or I’m far away, and the body I’m watching is beaching with an animal’s wail. I know how to swim—so it’s not a premonition. The first time I dunked under, and the rushing vacuum swamped by blue, that’s when I knew, &amp; I felt comforted. The sobs come—so it’s like a nightmare—like my brain has been bucked from my body’s back—like it’s an other—and then it’s over. I’m still on the sidelines. Breath settling into grooves. Father back in focus. Light too all the right proportions. Hey hey hey where are you he says.</p><p>***</p><p>Older &amp; wiser. My hand is a key in a vertical seam of rock, I jam and turn it inward, so the skin breaks around my last knuckle. That’s what tape is for. I don’t have any. Not extreme, just forgetting. Second time for the Book, where every perfect sequence is written to scale some sorrow. It’s like being played—the instrument I first had singing, hiding in the wind cavity of my chest and stringing over the larynx—the muscle cords roping my back through my fingertips, all tense to attention. Fear too, near-terror in the slightly moist indentation of the rocks, the way they dapple and get sticky with sunlight in the fades of afternoon, publishing illusions of steps. How to slip—trusting feet, lovely friction cored out like iron rods of force—in a deadpoint dropdead throw of center. Hit it or don’t, fall, or come down, or hang out by a rope listing down from the piton of a friend. Nothing can come up here with you. Panic too, all waters shut off. Crossing feet, now smooth cool breath furls up the granite.</p><p>***</p><p>Coming back past the river, a leaf falls, the day injected into its veins. Autumn parachutes in off thicker clouds. There are panics here, flickering and snickering with the snaps of leaves. This time I pass under more easily, and grins don’t hurt my face, and water slicks my hair fierce. Other times, there are bats and cockroaches and who knows what else. It starts over, I think. So many times the missingness seeps through walled-off parts of myself to infect each. It doesn’t go away. I only know how to rescue things, and hold them off from the edge, with all the muscles in my back. Intimate &amp; inanimate, far away, high up and falling back. Dense unyielding weather beaten dappled lovely. I keep committing to the next move.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Rather than a shared place or characteristic, one’s <i>karass</i> pivots around a <i>wampeter</i>, a unifying theme or purpose. As I understand it, <i>karass</i>es exist in something like <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>’s “fourth-dimension,” where truths invisible to us three-dimensioned Earthlings become apparent.</p><p>Reading <i>Cat’s Cradle</i> this winter, I was struck by its resemblance to David Foster Wallace’s <i>Infinite Jest</i>. My curiosity grew when I could find almost no evidence that Wallace had recognized Vonnegut’s influence (please correct me if you can). The unacknowledged resemblance dares me to take a leap of Bokononist faith and propose that the two authors, unbeknownst to them, might have belonged to the same <i>karass.</i></p><p><i><span id=\"more-500\"></span></i></p><p>In a minor parallel, both writers have posthumously returned to the bookstores in the past year—Kurt Vonnegut with his recently published collection of letters, and David Foster Wallace with <i>Both Flesh and Not</i>. In a review of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/books/review/kurt-vonneguts-letters.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">Kurt Vonnegut: Letters</a>, Kurt Andersen identifies an affinity between Vonnegut and Wallace in their respective suicide attempts, Wallace’s devastatingly successful. While Vonnegut did not die in 1984 when he tried to take his own life, he did in 2007, a year before Wallace’s attempt succeeded. Andersen describes Wallace as Vonnegut’s descendant, the “younger generation’s depressed and singular countercultural literary superstar.”</p><div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 385px\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"281\" src=\"http://splitsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/davidfosterwallace.jpg\" width=\"375\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>David Foster Wallace, an unknowing descendant of Kurt Vonnegut?

Image courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.splitsider.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.splitsider.com</a></em></p><p>While David Foster Wallace and Kurt Vonnegut may well be literary relatives, their <i>wampeter</i> runs deeper than a bond of depression and countercultural achievement. It is worth noting some broad correspondences between <i>Cat’s Cradle</i> and <i>Infinite Jest</i>, both of which take place in the brief calm after an apocalyptic storm—Vonnegut’s, historical; Wallace’s, futuristic. <i>Cat’s Cradle</i> is set after the bombing of Hiroshima; <i>Infinite Jest</i>, after an event that leaves much of Canada and some of North America (now “O.N.A.N”) a toxic wasteland. In addition to these global cataclysms, both novels are preceded by deaths of a smaller scale. Before <i>Cat’s Cradle</i> begins, Felix Hoenikker, the inventor of the atomic bomb and ice-nine—a chemical that freezes you dead at first touch—dies from his latter invention. He leaves his children, Angela, Frank and Newt (a dwarf), bereft of their enigmatic and fatally creative father. Before <i>Infinite Jest</i> begins, James Orin Incandenza, a prolific filmmaker whose repertoire included “Infinite Jest”—a motion picture that leaves you dead at first viewing—blows himself up in a jerry-rigged microwave. His leaves his children, Hal, Orin and Mario (a dwarf), bereft of their enigmatic and fatally creative father.</p><p><i>Cat’s Cradle</i> and <i>Infinite Jest</i> also feature spiritual gurus (Bokonon; Lyle), superlatively beautiful women (Mona Aamos Monzano; Joelle) and invented vocabularies (Vonnegut designs terminology for Bokononism; Wallace churns out anagrams to typify his futuristic, subsidized America).</p><p>What unites Vonnegut and Wallace in my mind, however, is not <i>what</i> they wrote about (eerily similar though it may be) but <i>how</i> they wrote it. Both writers, despite their dark biographies and fictional landscapes, succeeded in portraying the grim and bleak with humor and humanity. D. T. Max quotes David Foster Wallace in his <i>New Yorker</i> article, “<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/03/09/090309fa_fact_max?currentPage=2\" target=\"_blank\">The Unfinished</a>”: “Really good fiction could have as dark a worldview as it wished, but it’d find a way both to depict this world and to illuminate the possibilities for being alive and human in it.” Vonnegut may have been more expressive of his pessimism than Wallace; indeed it was Vonnegut who <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/04/kurt-vonneguts-8-tips-on-how-to-write-a-great-story/255401/\" target=\"_blank\">instructed the aspiring writer</a> to “make awful things happen” to his story’s characters, and Vonnegut’s own life—marked by his mother’s suicide on Mother’s Day in 1944 and his witnessing of the bombing of Dresden a year later— seems at times as though it were plotted with this instruction in mind. Like Wallace, however, Vonnegut wielded an unerring sense of humor; with this, he, too, illuminated within a world however bleak “the possibilities for being alive and human.”</p><div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 260px\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"203\" src=\"http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/images/Vonnegut4.jpg\" width=\"250\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Both Vonnegut and Wallace find the humor in the grim. Image courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.laphamsquarterly.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.laphamsquarterly.org</a></em></p></div><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Both Vonnegut and Wallace find the humor in the grim. Image courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.laphamsquarterly.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.laphamsquarterly.org</a></em></p><p>Vonnegut’s and Wallace’s characters treat bluntly and jestingly their own misfortunes, to darkly humorous effect. In Cat’s Cradle, Angela, Newt, and Frank take frequent detours as they recount to the narrator the day they discovered their dead father. Before they found him frozen on the porch, they came across a dishrag that had met the same fate; Newt describes that it “reminded [him] right away of Mother’s reticule, of how the reticule felt,” and Angela “explains sentimentally that when a child, Newt had treasured his mother’s gold reticule.” Yet there is no equivalently sentimental explanation of Newt’s next discovery: that, along with their dog, their “father was stiff, too.” The children and narrator then proceed to confront yet another victim of ice-nine, Papa Monzano, whom they hide in a closet in order to “simplify the tableau” of his hospital room. The humor in the scene, and throughout the novel, lies in the dissonance between subject and description: a dead body is rhetorically added to a dead dishrag and dog, and another is hidden in the closet as an object no more valuable than a man-sized mop.</p><p>This dissonant humor surfaces in <i>Infinite Jest</i> as well, perhaps most strikingly in the scene parallel to that in <i>Cat’s Cradle</i>. Orin calls Hal to discuss their father’s suicide, and Hal is only disturbed by the conversation insofar as it distracts him from his nail- clipping. After revealing that he was the one to find his father’s wrecked body, he proceeds to describe his tactic: “the clippers are poised, blades on either side of the nail.” Later, when he explains the physics of the death, he compares his father’s head to a potato, asking Orin if he has ever “baked a potato in a microwave oven?” and did he know why “you have to cut the potato open before you turn the oven on?”</p><p>For many philosophers, humor is borne of incongruity. According to Schopenhauer, “the cause of laughter in every case is simply the sudden perception of the incongruity between a concept and the real objects which have been thought through it in some relation.” In the scenes I describe, laughter is invoked by precisely this incongruity: the concept of death is intimately related, in both context and association, to such objects as a dishrag, a reticule, a dog, a tableau, nail-clippings, and a baked-potato. The dissonance between weighty actuality and light description is humorous; that those who lightly describe the weighty actuality are those who should be most heavily affected by it, is unsettling. Biographies and plot aside, it is Vonnegut’s and Wallace’s dark sense of humor, their eye for the incongruities in life, for the yang of despair’s yin, that unite the two writers in a formidable <i>karass</i>.</p><p><!--more--></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

I spent the summer living on the Harvard Business School campus. There are lots of rabbits over there and, if you pay attention to the animals, you’ll see there are squirrels and rabbits and that they don’t occupy the same space. I would come home at night having just seen five, six rabbits every day. And they’re just so cute. So it was this experience of seeing them, getting to have this different geography of Harvard—of where particular animals live and don’t live.</p><p>CV: I hadn’t even thought about Harvard, though that may tie into my next question, which on the “ferrovitreous cistern collecting/ dimensionless shadows of European attitudes.” The poem is so focused on the natural, mystic world, and then there’s this striking image of human presence.</p><p>MTF: I think what comes to mind visually is Widener Library, particularly on the second and third levels where you can see this brilliant light coming through thee windows in the interior courtyard, which formerly were exterior courtyards. I was trying to write based on observations I made daily while walking around in Cambridge and I think that’s why there is this particular man-made object in contrast to the natural objects. And the word “ferrovitreous”— I approached this poem with an exercise from Jorie Graham. Take any book and go through it page-by-page, writing down a list of interesting words. The wordlist for this poem came from <em>The Railway Journey </em>by Wolfgang Schivelbusch. It’s an historical consideration of how the railroads in Europe altered perceptions of time and space. Ferrovitreous was a word that popped up and it made me think of Widener.</p><p>CV: Did you choose that book specifically as a pair for this poem?</p><p>MTF: No, it was pretty random. I regularly check books out of the library, borrowing 50 to 60 books total at any given time. I picked up this book and another by Schivelbusch<strong>.</strong> I decided I wouldn’t have time to read them fully—just time enough to pick them up and skim. In the future, I might go back to that particular list of words and write another poem from it. The seeds of this poem were particular words that came from this particular book, but I chose it because I had to return it to the library.</p><p>CV: An element of this poem that generated a lot of discussion on the board was the really exuberant language. It’s almost bombastic. What made you decide to write in that register; was it was because those were the words you were coming across?</p><p>MTF: I think, partially, it was because these particular words were chosen as the seed material for the poem. They seemed to fit together in my mind. I think also there was something about the rabbit and the ear that made me conscious of sound and to prefer the longer lines and longer words. More exuberant, multisyllabic types of words. But my writing is still pretty fluid poem to poem. At the time, I’d been reading some of A.R. Ammons and had read Denis Johnson—both are completely different from this. Very sparse. If anything it’s likely a reaction to what I had been reading recently, what I had wanted to be different from.</p><p>CV: Speaking of language, language—both of the rabbit and the human—is both entrapping and liberating in this poem. That was something that I was trying to work through. Could you talk about that?</p><p>MTF: I think anybody who becomes interested in language comes across the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which I think has been shown to be incorrect by Chomsky and his universal grammar. But the idea is that the language you speak constrains what you can say and therefore constrains what you can conceive of. For example, a language lacking tenses found in other languages, might lend a speaker a different perception of time. And again it becomes absurd to say people can’t conceive of the future because there’s really no functional future tense. It’s always interested me, the idea that what you know how to say in some way constrains what you can say. Poetry sets these constraints on what you’re going to write. Yet, you continue trying to make it interesting, to make it new. I think there’s a natural tendency, then, for poems to address this issue. And there’s isolation in the poem, which ties into that—the fact that language is essentially what enables us to have community, connection, understanding, empathy. But the lack of it, the misuse of it, or the inability to use it can leave you on the outside. That relates to the interaction between a human being and a rabbit because we have no way to communicate with each other. I have no way of knowing what they think of when they hear human speech or hear human footsteps. Just as, I’m sure, they might have squeaks in registers of sound that we can’t even hear. That’s been found with elephants: that they can talk to each other over miles in very low frequency tones that without recording equipment and manipulation just are inaudible to us.</p><p>CV: Right, I got a strong sense of social anxiety, or anxiety about interacting with the rabbit and, once you’re the rabbit, with other rabbits in this poem, which is really interesting considering how confident the tone is in being able to communicate to this audience.</p><p>MTF: I think that’s definitely true: that social anxiety can obscure inward confidence just as outward confidence can obscure an inward anxiety. That’s something that I’ve come to terms with in different ways. On campus, there’s been a lot of talk about mental health and suicide; in an earlier form, the poem did reference that more strongly. Having experienced anxiety, social anxiety and generalized anxiety, I felt it was important to bring such experience into the poem.</p><p>CV: Another question about imagery that I have is on scale, which is out of control in this poem, and I mean that in the best way. In the same two lines we have the Andromeda galaxy and the amount of snow being kicked up by a rabbit. We have a warren and the entire universe. Was your mind flying between images and galaxies while writing this? What made you play with the scale so much?</p><p>MTF: Playing with scale definitely begins with becoming the rabbit, because there’s this transition from the human scale to the rabbit scale. It continues up to this image of snow being kicked up into the air and resembling a galaxy of stars. Each flake being a star or a series of stars close together. I forget where Andromeda came from, but one of my classes this semester is in astronomy. We’ve talked a lot about galaxies and stars. The mythological root behind Andromeda, a princess to be sacrificed, but who also waits to be saved—that’s also where it comes from. The fact that a star would be frightened is a strange thought to have.</p><p>CV: I also wanted to ask you about the ending: “I accelerate out of lens focus/ beyond the pointillistic boundary.” There’s some movement beyond this minute scale, beyond the ability to even perceive things. What’s going on there?</p><p>MTF: The ending now is very different from the original ending. The original ending was much more slapstick. It was essentially being hit on the head by a tree branch while chasing the rabbit. I figured the movement the poem needed was expansion outward into someplace different. Part of my thinking was about the scale, about how small an atom is, how small its parts are. I think it can be read two ways almost: becoming so large that the lens—eyesight or vision—goes out of focus as things become so large they’re just dot-like. And also to become small, to go into the infinitesimal space. I had recently finished watching a documentary about film history, and a particular reference comes from Ingmar Bergman’s <em>Persona</em>, the scene when the filmstrip literally starts to melt. A psychedelic mental breakdown portrayed on screen. That’s part of what inspired those particular lines. The reader identifies with the speaker, has to pick up all of the momentum, and really just vanish.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

The conversation doesn’t go well after that. </span><span id=\"more-1824\"></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> He had seemed approachable, standing with his back to the brick wall next to a smoke shop on Dorchester Street. Approachable in the sense that he wasn’t in a hurry, leaning back against that wall. I’d already been shut down by two potential interviewees: one a South Asian cashier in a corner store whose eyes grew suspicious the moment the word interview tumbled from my mouth, the other a man waiting for the bus by some empty Tyvek’ed building frames (“I’m just not sure I’ll have time to give you much of a story before it comes”). I wanted someone who had nowhere to go. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Wearing an old North Face fleece, he is unmoving despite the chill and slight flecks of wet snow falling; he has the caved-in mouth of someone who has lost a few teeth, but his eyes—blue and direct, clear—suggest he has some time to kill and no obvious antagonism toward strangers.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> I ask, “Do you mind if I talk to you for a few minutes? It’ll be recorded.”</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> In his own words: “I’m seventy and I don’t give a fuck.”</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> So I ask him if he lives around here. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> He came, he says, when he was seven. Seven days, that is—my first tip-off that it’s not all exactly right. His speech trails off for a moment. What’s strange, though, is that he catches himself. He apologizes. “Ah, seven, seven”—he struggles with the word ‘years’ and tries to explain—“I have a hard time, because I got hit in the head”—he takes off his hat to show me—“three, four times.” </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> “What happened?”<br>\r\n“He got—a person got pissed off, in my house and… that’s what he did… and I was on the floor, and there was blood that far apart. And now I have a hard time dealing with shit.”</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> He leans forward as he says it, and I get the first waft of cinnamon-sweet alcohol, not harsh but simply there. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> The dimple in the middle of his upper lip starts to look a lot more like scar tissue. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> In <i>Good Will Hunting</i>, the violence is cartoonish, unthreatening. Will and friends go to a Little League game and drink, and then they spot Carmine Scarpaglia, an Italian man who used to beat Will up in kindergarten. There’s no fight, though, at least not yet—it’s not until Will sees Carmine harassing a woman on the street that he gets out of his car and attacks him. It’s a cosmically just fight, and it’s also a goofy scene—Morgan comically bemoans the fact that they bought snacks first, and the slow motion action shots combined with feel-good, chill music suggests that, like a cartoon, nothing truly terrible is going to happen. Although Will eventually goes too far, punching Carmine over and over again in the face, the rules of the movie don’t allow him to do irrevocable damage. This is not a place where people die or become brain-damaged out of the blue. The scene demonstrates Will’s emotional instability—it doesn’t try to paint South Boston as a place of death. If anything, it has a glossy, nostalgic view of old-school Southie, where rights and wrongs are settled by fists (but nothing worse). The violence is, in a way, not violence, precisely because it has rules and order and expectations.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> But maybe South Boston is getting just as one-sided of a treatment from the man in front of me. Despite “getting fucked up,”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>he is remarkably clear-headed. More than anything he seems drunk, not out-of-it per se—the difference being that his conversation is on-topic and to the point, although he occasionally slurs or forgets words. I start to wonder how much of the described violence is real—and then immediately get embarrassed at my own doubt. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> The conversation shifts to family: the man has three kids, Annie, David, and one whose name he doesn’t remember, although that one “is a fucking dickweed.” Annie’s good to him, he says—they see each other maybe two or three times a year, since she lives nearby, closer to the harbor. She even has three kids of her own. David has no kids, but the man doesn’t seem upset by that. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Two or three visits a year don’t seem like much of a social life, so I ask him if he has close friends around. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> “Not so much, not anymore.”</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Again, he doesn’t seem upset by it.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> “I went to school, and anyone that was around it, if they wanted to fuck with me, I used to kick them in the balls.” He pantomimes it with me. “But I stopped going to school in seventh grade, and started painting houses and shit, and I did that all my life.”</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> “When did you stop?”</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> “About, uh, seven years ago. I just couldn’t, couldn’t do it anymore. With my head.”</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> “What do you do now?”<br>\r\n“I walk, most, all days. Every day. And, uh, a couple of these,” (he shows me a nip of Fireball) “you know, a little help. And uh, that’s what I do. It’s all right.”</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> He strikes me as so unapologetic—not happy but not unhappy. Most of the meaning that I think about in my own imagined future come from a job, partner, kids, friends; but unlike in the movies, this man’s never been tempted to search out something else, at least not at the moment. When Will loses the girl, he “ha[s] to see” about her. He can’t let that meaning slip out of his life. In this world, the man in front of me stayed. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> I ask him if he ever considered moving. He says no, because he liked what he was doing and where he was. I wait for more. There isn’t any more.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> So I ask him where he lives now.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> “I live right down there.” (He points back toward the Station.) He adds, “I’ll cut them motherfuckers down there.”</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Surprised, I ask him who he means.<br>\r\n“Where I live, it’s hard. Some of those people they come and up to you and they say, hey, give me some fucking money. I’ve got a knife this long, the handle’s here, and I’ll put it in here,” (he points to my abdomen) “and I’ll cut you to your fucking ass.” He shows me where he keeps it.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> “So do you feel safe most of the time?</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> “You’re never certain, no, you’re never, you’re never actually totally, no. You gotta keep your ass together.”</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> I try to think of a way to steer the conversation somewhere else, but this is where it’s going. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> “Blacks, blacks, you know, a lot of blacks” (he leans in) “are hard-ass motherfuckers. I’ve only, I’ve only stuck a knife in one of them. And everyone around me now, they know, they know I’ve got a knife. And they say, Johnson, Johnson, he’s fucking crazy.”</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> That extreme, casual mention of violence is so foreign to me—the shock partly is the word “only,” that the man thinks stabbing only one person is a feat of forbearance. My responses to him get more clipped. Not out of antagonism, though. My brain just isn’t providing me with the associative directions to push the conversation toward.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> I end up cutting off the conversation—after getting his name, Michael Edward Johnson—and walking back to the station. Along the way I keep looking back, and once, a runner in Nike nylons skitters across my peripherals, jangling my nerves. Johnson’s not following me, but I imagine him in intricate detail rolling up his pant leg, unbuckling his knife, planning to stick it handle-deep in my abdomen without a pantomime. I imagine the shock. My inability to process—my eyes wide and direct looking into his blue, thin-ringed irises—his unapologetic expression. And, once again, I get embarrassed at my own reaction.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Incongruity is scary. It’s a mental violence. It tears the easy stream of thoughts encasing us. This man on Dorchester Street has stabbed someone and carries a knife even now. I’m stunned partly because, unlike the movies, there is no music or artistic hand to guide the action. In movies there are rules about when and how violence occurs, but in life there are so few. Of course, again, it occurs to me that what he said to me could have been boasting. As he himself said, the reputation and gossip and rumor, what people say about him, that “he’s crazy,” is more of a safety blanket than the actual knife. Still, my gut says that he wasn’t lying. His casual mention of it suggests no intent to impress me. He certainly doesn’t perceive me as a threat. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Over my shoulder, the last thing I heard him say: “So now you’ve got something.”</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Yes, I say. I’ve got something. And nowhere to put it.</span></p>",

The Rolls Royce-driving, Yankees-cap-wearing, 2000s-rap-troping Booba—a cultural annex of the US and of questionable originality—is arguably the most recognizable name in current French hip-hop. Sometimes he raps about how <a href=\"http://genius.com/3489381/Booba-3g/Revolution-de-lover-tu-nas-que-3-followers\">other rappers have fewer twitter followers than he</a>. And he garners upwards of 2 million views on every stacks-and-sportscar-intensive video he puts out.<span id=\"more-1718\"></span></p><p>Somewhere on the opposite end of Francophone rap’s aesthetic spectrum are what we might call hoards of young, unaffiliated, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJnPl4BruUA\">often faceless rappers</a> whose medium of choice is the pithy freestyle. Their music videos are largely in the throwback style of Joey Bada$$—the crew riding through their neighborhood and exerting some kind of imagined dominance over their surroundings. Fragmented into innumerable collectives and creative partnerships, their presence depends almost entirely on the hype they can inspire.</p><p>Georgio, 22 years old and a native of Paris’s 18th arrondissement, belongs to this second category. He’s been inspiring hype since he put out his 2013 EP <i>Soleil d’hiver</i> and has a devoted, vocal following. He’s not signed, no Wikipedia article exists on him, his most popular videos haven’t broken 1,000,000 views, and apparently he doesn’t even make enough money to avoid <a href=\"http://genius.com/2432620/Georgio-homme-de-lombre/Mais-ils-savent-pas-que-pour-snourrir-georgio-vole-a-monoprix\">having to steal food from Monoprix</a> (Monoprix is like a French CVS, except much cuter and more varied in its inventory).</p><p>He doesn’t have a gimmick, either. Lacking in the narrative virtuosity of, say, Kendrick Lamar or the meta-rap discourse of Earl Sweatshirt, Georgio relies on little more than engaging wordplay, a personal rapport with his fans, and the appearance of keeping it real. Taking rap back to the ‘90s realism of Kool G Rap and early Jay Z, Georgio’s oeuvre is largely a portrait of Parisian street life for a marginalized class of adolescents, delivered with an attitude somewhere between indignant and resigned. “<a href=\"http://genius.com/2721964/Georgio-tu-sais-cqui-spasse/Dans-lquartier-cest-pas-les-hommes-mais-cest-les-balles-qui-percent\"><i>Dans le quartier c’est pas les hommes mais c’est les balles qui percent</i></a>,” (in this neighborhood, it’s not people that break through but bullets) he raps on “<i>Tu sais c’qui s’passe</i>” in a slick play on the double meaning of <i>percer</i>—to pierce, or to break through into mainstream success.</p><p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"407\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/CH7mOXLC_V0?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"670\"></iframe></span></p><p>Or consider his menacingly good verse on “<i>A tous les coups</i>,” in which he brandishes his youth (“I started my revolution before I even knew how to boil pasta”), questions the status quo (“Why did 3/4 of my bros grow up without a dad?”), and links the motif of this track to the popular expression <i>faire les quatre cents coups</i> (“to raise hell”), a motif shared by François Truffaut’s seminal <i>Nouvelle Vague</i> film, <i>Les 400 coups</i> (<i>The 400 Blows</i>). Whether or not Georgio intended to remind us of it, Truffaut’s film famously centers on a troublemaking adolescent growing up in Paris—not unlike Georgio’s portrait of himself as a lawbreaking “<i>p’tit con</i>” (little asshole) in the first line of “<i>Conclusion</i>.”</p><p>Yet, often reluctant to rap about defying the law without acknowledging its personal effects, Georgio begins the title track of his 2014 EP <i>A l’abri</i> by admitting that “Our errors are what hurt our mothers the worst… it wasn’t easy for us, with just as much love as screams.” This willingness to address personal or social problems reappears in “<i>Le poing levé les yeux bandés</i>,” also off <i>l’abri</i>, in which he reminds us that “we grew up like wolves, not those bougie kids who take classes at the Sorbonne” while complicating the “live fast, die young” rap trope: “I’ve placed in question the value of a long life; I’m like Nietzsche, they’ll only understand me once I die.” Flattering comparisons will always exaggerate, but I think that it’s lines like this, in which an American rap fan might hear the echo of Mos Def’s deft lyricism or Nas’s <i>Illmatic</i>-era erudition, that make Georgio worth listening to.</p><p>But my focus on Georgio’s precocious gravity doesn’t mean he lacks a sense of humor. In his ‘80s-kitsch video for “Blackjack,” he raps about crack destroying families over a moving background of absurd casino-themed stock footage while wearing a Steve-Jobs style black turtleneck and a lipstick-red blazer. This chroma keying gets pushed to its natural, absurd extremes. At one point in the video, a salt-shaker-sized Georgio stands pan-faced, rapping on the green felt of a blackjack table while surrounded by relatively enormous betting chips.</p><p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"407\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/h2q4S3qp9-M?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"670\"></iframe></span></p><p>Nevertheless, Georgio’s Lacoste feels dated (even though he’s explained in <a href=\"http://skudmag.com/2014/05/30/georgio-je-vis-le-meilleur-truc-que-lon-pouvait-me-souhaiter/\">an interview</a> that this is intentional), his instrumentals are far from pushing genre barriers, and as I mentioned earlier, there are many, many independent rappers in France—in Paris—engaged in a similar stylistic project (the potentially-offensive <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDLePxDYz78\">Vald¹</a> and the stone-cold members of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSzVWijz04Y\">TSR CREW²</a> to name only a few). But what’s exciting about Georgio is his return to locality and the feeling of authenticity it engenders in an era of increasingly cosmopolitan rap. As he puts it in “<i>Le poing levé</i>,” “I’ve got the choice between my neighborhood or touring the world.” So far, he’s chosen his neighborhood. So when he shouts “Putain d’XV3” (fucking XV3 = the 18th arrondissement) or “MARX DO” (short for Marx Dormoy, the metro-stop classification for Georgio’s neighborhood) before a particularly hard-hitting verse, you get the feeling that this is more than mindless self-branding. Factor in his surgical flow and ingenious writing, and Georgio becomes just as catchily synecdochic as these nicknames for his neighborhood—he stands in for a whole clan of listeners, friends, and <i>p’tits cons</i>. As he reminds us in “<i>Tu sais c’qui s’passe</i>,” “Just like you, I’m from the poor families of France—even if there are worse.”</p><p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"407\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/atCHB3Sk4gA?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"670\"></iframe></span></p><p>Yet the question of whom exactly he represents when he makes these comments is impossible to avoid. Of Caribbean origin, Georgio is part of the postcolonial legacy of immigrants in France.³ Facing economic adversity, he belongs to a certain social milieu. (He’s not a boogie kid who takes courses at the Sorbonne, remember?) And in most of his music videos, northern Paris is the default scenery, backing up Georgio’s affirmations of local identity. In the video for his newest track “Indomptable,” he raps in what seem to be dimly-lit Parisian alcoves while dropping lines like “I always speak the truth, independent like Gandhi… It’s 1 for my province, then 2 for my Parisians.” So while Georgio’s incontrovertibly French, there’s something new about his Frenchness, something that makes him inseparable from <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/21/world/europe/a-french-education-minister-who-knows-immigrants-struggle.html\">conversations about social and ethnic divisions in twenty-first-century France</a>. If you’re feeling generous, you might think of Balzac’s iconic Eugène de Rastignac, the young man disillusioned by Parisian society who looks out over the city from the north and says, “Henceforth there is war between us.” But if you believe, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2005/11/david_brooks_playa_hater.html\">like David Brooks, that in French hip-hop there is no progress, only blind appropriation</a>, then you might consider Georgio a simple successor to OG hip-hop acts of the ‘90s like Suprême NTM and Ärsenik—that is, part of a new generation of cultural kidney stones France needs to pass.</p><p>In the meantime, Georgio’s fan base is growing and his flow is getting tighter. His writing has matured, linking countless references and quips together and proving his technical excellence again and again. So maybe technical excellence and street cred. are all Georgio needs to stay relevant. Maybe they’re not. We’ll see. As Jean Cocteau has noted, “Paris has an ostrich’s stomach. It digests everything. It assimilates nothing.”</p><p>¹ In this video Vald plays the role of a young man who murders his family while rapping “I fuck the world as if I were autistic.”</p><p>² Hugo has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFQTjl0L72k\">recently cited</a> Hugo Boss of TSR CREW as one of his influences.</p><p>³  In “<i>Homme de l’ombre</i>,” Georgio says both that he’s “<a href=\"http://genius.com/920765/Georgio-homme-de-lombre/Mais-sale-batard-pas-damalgame-moi-jviens-de-guadeloupe\">from Guadeloupe</a>” and that he’s “proud to come from Pointe à Pitre,” Guadeloupe’s primary urban center.</p><p>by Lucas Quatrecasas ’18</p><p class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\r\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\r\n\r\n</p>\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);</p>",

Surely, I think, any detail that alights on my finely-tuned consciousness will also prove itself a Chekhovian story-germ.

		"title" : "Toni Morrison on Good and Evil",
		"slug" : "2012-12-14-toni-morrison-on-good-and-evil",
		"body" : "<p>“I’ve never been interested or impressed by evil itself, but I have been confounded by how attractive it is to others, and stunned by the attention given to its every whisper, its every shout. Evil has a blockbuster audience, while goodness lurks backstage.”</p><p>-Toni Morrison</p><p>Such was the gilded tone and subject matter that enthralled attendees of Morrison’s Ingersoll Lecture at Harvard last week, in a talk entitled, “Goodness: Altruism and the Literary Imagination.” While she began by detailing a moving instance of human altruism and her resulting investigation into its scientific routes, Morrison quickly turned her attention to how goodness and its antithesis are represented in literature. Her thesis focused on the worrisome obsession with “evil” in modern texts: a fixation that, she claimed, renders wickedness in great complexity and depth. Good, on the other hand, finds only superficial representation. It is too often depicted as merely bland or insipid, a sort of tasteless water to evil’s enthralling blood.</p><p>It’s not difficult to see the manifestations of Morrison’s claim in a broader cultural landscape. Serial killers form the basis for everything from films to scholarly investigation; Jokers, rather than Batmans, tend to be the subjects of our analyses and imitations. We want to understand how someone could want to watch the world burn. Plus, there’s seductiveness in the wicked: it’s both lascivious and enigmatic, threatening and empowering. When otherwise controlled, collected people hedonistically belt out lyrics to Rihanna’s “Disturbia” or revel in one of Macbeth’s harrowing soliloquies, they’re not simply performing. To say “I feel like a monster” is to enter and construct an alternate, perhaps emancipating, identity.</p><p>Yet the application of Morrison’s theory to literature, in particular her own, initially troubled me. She decries the literary overuse of evil; yet vileness is so often found at the core of her novels. Consider the opening lines to <i>Paradise</i>: “They shoot the white girl first. With the rest they can take their time.” Or the scene in <i>The Bluest Eye, </i>legendary for its beauty and horror, when Cholly violates his daughter Pecola. Surely these atrocities must be considered evil? And then there are the societal cruelties in Morrison’s works: the soil that eviscerates both marigolds and Pecola; the community in <i>Beloved</i> that cannibalistically turns on Baby Suggs; the overwhelming specter of slavery that haunts Morrison’s texts so fiercely and  frequently. What I love about her novels is that they neither shy away from these villainies nor depict them in simplistic terms. To do the first would be idealistic; to do the second would be unwise. Evil is complex, and as an enemy, it first must be respected in order to be repelled. Morrison’s characters and texts seem to realize this, so why did her lecture reject it?</p><p>Perhaps, in fact, it did not. While the starkness of Morrison’s labels might encourage a binary approach towards her own and others’ novels—as rendering <em>either</em> good <em>or</em> evil—I believe this is precisely the interpretive style she seeks to rebuff. True, Morrison’s novels may often sing of wickedness, but each horror seems harmonized with a tenacious, vibrant good, a virtue or honesty that explicitly asserts a resonant voice. Morrison does not seek to censor or discount evil, but instead to elevate and elaborate its more comely counterpart. After all, the veritable queen of the open text—she who explores the “how” rather than the “why” in <i>The Bluest Eye</i> or places a literally indecipherable inscription on an oven as the central symbol in <i>Paradise</i>—would seem amiss in returning to the 19<sup>th</sup> century tradition of permitting goodness to invariably triumph.</p><p>I’m reminded here of a quotation from another of my favorite authors, Salman Rushdie, who says of the novel, “It is not an arena to revere; it claims no special rights except the right to be the stage upon which the great debates of society can be conducted.” Morrison, too, seems to advocate “no special rights” in her texts, no synthetic plot construction that permits the absolute victory of virtue. Indeed, she mounts these “great debates,” continually layering her narratives with the intricacies and complications that scald like embers and impel her readers to construct their own fiery discourses. What, then, does Morrison want of goodness? No more and no less than a role on “the stage,” a pulpit from which to speak, and, perhaps, to enthrall. That is, if it can find words with the elegance and majesty of Morrison’s own.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

		"body" : "<p>It was the age of Thomas Pynchon and the <em>nouveau roman. </em>Italo Calvino was beginning to map out his invisible cities. And in Paris, in 1963, the Argentine émigré Julio Cortázar added his novel <em>Rayuela</em>—“Hopscotch”—to a jagged landscape of literary experimentation. Cortázar was born in Brussels, grew up in Buenos Aires, lived in Paris for thirty years. Scholars string him in or between the webs of modernism, surrealism, and magical realism. His work is perhaps in, but not of, them all.</p><p>The first story I read by Cortázar was called “The Continuity of the Parks.” In it a man settles into a green velvet chair to read another story, in which a woman and her lover plot to kill her husband. At the end the lover enters the living room of the house to kill the husband. He finds him sitting with his back to the door, reading a short story in a green velvet chair.</p><p><span id=\"more-47\"></span></p><p>This kind of intellectual playfulness is characteristic of the author. It serves partly as a framework for Cortázar’s metaphysics in <em>Rayuela</em>, his placement of paradise as attainable only diagonally, almost accidentally (in Argentine hopscotch, you move from Earth to Heaven). It is also supposed to suggest the possibility of infinite readings. <em>Rayuela </em>is not one but two novels: the first can be read straight through, ignoring 55 “expendable” chapters at the end; the second by following a map provided by the author, “hopscotch-ing” through all the chapters for a different story.</p><p>Cortázar gives several meta-winks to the reader, nudging him in the right experimental direction. There is a point when Horacio Oliveira, the protagonist, is collecting scraps of drafts for a book by Morelli, an aging author. He worries aloud that he has upset the order of the novel. Morelli says that it doesn’t much matter howthe book is read; it is left to the reader to decide.</p><p><em>Rayuela </em>asks, really demands, the reader to actively participate in the writing and reading of the story. Some readers, Cortázar insinuates—the <em>lector hembra, </em>or “female reader”—will be content to read straight through, adhering to safe traditional linearity. It was clear to me which one I would rather be. Is a book still experimental, when the author provides such clear signposts for the experiment? Even if these signposts point to nothing more than the slanted meaning of a chalked-out children’s game?</p><p>Cortázar asks much of the reader but also hands much to him: beckoning him into his worldview, folding him into the contours of his cosmology. He zooms in easily from the infinite to the infinitesimal. He has an ear for colloquial <em>porteño </em>Spanish unmatched by anyone I’ve read before; if the streams of consciousness and endless philosophizing can be a bit much, their pitch, at least, is perfect. But I had to ask myself, reading <em>Rayuela, </em>how much the spiraling experimentation is meant to augment a straightforward narrative of exile and return—or, perhaps, to conceal it.</p><p>It would obviously be a mistake to equate Cortázar’s biography with his work. But I can’t help but wonder if such a brilliant mind (and he was, undoubtedly, brilliant) struggled to deal with themes close to his heart but hardened, almost, into a pastiche of exile—difficult to crack open under the layers of cliché.  So the hopscotch-ing chapters and the endless sentences and Joycean streams could be distilled, ultimately, into a catalogue of what it is like to be homeless. Which is, finally, ambiguous and experimental. It is a state of mind and place that can perhaps only be ordered into diagonal, splintered meaning—making meaning itself, perhaps, no more than an experiment.</p><p>By Victoria Baena ’14</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

I wanted my bed to be home for me, a most special place to return to, so I turned it into a nest. I strung Christmas lights above my bed and then made a hung a canopy beneath the lights using my old, dark brown sheets. At night, when only the Christmas lights are turned on, the ceiling above resembles a constellation in the night sky.</p><p>There is a string of lights which did not make it above the canopy. It ascends from the socket and up the wall, towards the ceiling before it disappears behind the sheets. From far away the lights resemble dozens of fireflies, frozen in motion.</p><p><span id=\"more-800\"></span></p><p>The other day, I was just lying in bed with my glasses off. I purposefully take away my vision when I do not want to focus on anything in particular. I like to know that I can choose when I want to participate in the world. My gaze shifted to the string of lights—they had lost their pointed shape and become floating spheres of light, with a bright core and a fading halo at the edges.</p><p>My body felt like it was floating on the sheets, and my eyes were just seeing and not staring at anything in particular. I began to lose my sense of time when I suddenly realized that the lights were pulsing.</p><p>The halos were expanding and shrinking repeatedly. Each time the white core grew in intensity and caused the sphere to increase to about twice its size. Soon afterwards, it would shrink temporarily, and then burst out again in fits, first after a short pause, and then a longer pause. A thought came to my mind—could it be that the lights were pulsating at the same rhythm as my heart? Could it be that with each pump, the extra blood flow to my eyes made the cells more receptive to light?</p><p>I put my hand above my heart and listened, watching the lights as I felt for my pulse. It was indeed true! The lights were pulsating along with the rhythm of my heart. I stayed like this for a few more minutes. The lights dilated more with the systole and less so with the diastole.</p><p>After a few minutes, I threw myself under the covers, hiding from this spectacular. I could not believe this was truly happening. I thought of the blood gushing into my eyeballs, washing over each and every cell behind my retina. This was a breakthrough, I thought. I needed to see for myself if this was actually true, so I crawled out of the covers again and continued staring at the lights. After a few seconds, once my eyes had managed to unfocused their gaze, the little balls stared moving again. It was the same pattern, ceaselessly repeating itself to a heart which never fails.</p><p><em>Illustration by Alejandra Dean ’13</em></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

There’s a lot of denial of the history of feminism, and how movements have grown organically out of that history, have mutated. Even within feminism, there can be huge omissions and revisions of history. In any case, the use of “new feminism” by McNally Jackson and Semiotext(e) on the “Heroines” blurb just shows a lot of ignorance and narrowness of focus</p><p>And in some ways, maybe that narrowness is okay. I concede in my essay that there is kind of something, which we can call new feminism if we want although it’s really a completely absurd name, that appeals to a very particular market of mostly white, mostly straight, highly-educated literary women.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>But then it seems that this “new feminism” is reaching an audience of precisely the women who are least disabled by the forms of oppression that feminists feminists seek to attack?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, although sometimes I think there’s another side to that privilege–like with heterosexuality. I sense that a lot of what dominates “new feminism” is the struggle of being a heterosexual feminist. Of knowing  a lot of male “feminists” (not saying men cannot be feminist, of course, but I think we all know a male “feminist” when we see one). I think a by-product of third-wave feminism, especially how it has grown on the internet, is this idea that we should all be competing to be the most oppressed, and to care most about the most oppressed in this bizarre competitive way. But it’s often not this simple hierarchy of oppression.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>I wonder if the “new feminism” that we need would focus less on vertical achievement— on breaking the glass ceiling— and more on horizontal achievement— on providing basic rights (reproductive rights, childcare, etc.) for more, if not all, women?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, perhaps. Honestly, it might be stupid to be lumping together all these people in this “new feminist” demographic that I’m basically making up. If we’re including people who like Chris Kraus… I really like Chris Kraus!</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>So you’re including Zambreno and Chris Kraus in this category?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, sort of. The demographic of new feminists I have seen it includes women on one end who actually might be very well versed in certain aspects of feminist theory but who nonetheless have a certain narrowness of perspective that would enable them to read “Heroines” as an unproblematically feminist text. On the other end of the spectrum as I see it, there are women writing on Tumblr, people who take Marie Calloway’s work seriously as feminist, which is more ridiculous to me.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Totally. It’s tricky, though, because on the one hand I think it’s good to make women conscious of and opinionated about their own identity politics– to make us think about what it means to be a woman in today’s society. And I think that it’s good that there is some venue for women to do something like “feminism” in a really approachable, swallowable way. But, of course, the value of this is undermined by the poor value of the feminist content that you often find in such venues.</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes. It’s totally true that feminism should contain something different for everyone, and it should be culturally specific. What annoys me about someone like Marie Calloway, and the fact that Kate Zambreno wrote this article about her, is that these are women who I’m sure are capable of a much more sophisticated kind of feminism. This “fucked up girl” aesthetic that Zambreno writes about is just so teenagerish to me. There was that interesting article about the way young women and girls get involved with communities and stuff on Tumblr that encourage self-harm… (<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/10/social-media-is-redefining-depression/280818/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/10/social-media-is-redefining-depression/280818/</a>)</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>The internet is incredibly powerful!</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>And it seems irresponsible (as well as just silly) for smart, grown-up women writers to be fetishizing that or celebrating it or even just approving it. It’s true that the internet is powerful, and I worry that as content becomes increasingly personalized the internet will turn on feminism, or fail it.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Yes.</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Because people will just have their own views reconfirmed. I mean this is already happening, and with all aspects of online content. The “silver bubble” thing.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>An interesting reversal or over-extension of “the personal is political.”</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes that’s true</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>What appear to be platforms for freedom and choice are actually just driving us further inwards and narrowing our vision.</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yeah. So in that way I think feminism should maintain a very critical relationship to the internet.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>So I’m interested if you think there are any people today who write good and sophisticated culturally specific feminism, to recommend instead of Zambreno?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Do you mean on the internet or just in general?</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>I guess in general— I mean, you mentioned your interest in Donna Haraway and bell hooks?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes. bell hooks is a good person to mention because although she’s an academic her work does not read as dry or overly scholarly. I already mentioned Hilton Als, who might not even explicitly identify as a feminist, and who says some strange and borderline misogynist things sometimes, but whose crazy and radical way of thinking about the world is really helpful to the kind of feminism I want to practice. There is a cool reclamation and re-celebration of the more interesting radical feminists––Shulamith Firestone, Ellen Willis––that’s going on right now that I think is great. Beatriz Preciado, I am reading her book now, “Testo Junkie: Sex, Drugs, and Biopolitcs in the Pharmacopornographic Era”. It is dazzling.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Great!

Usually those times come after days already full of excess. Country fair and fried Twinkie kinds of days. Emotionally laden kinds of days—days in response to which doctors exhort patients to “not eat their feelings”. Yeah, right. People have been eating their feelings since Eve took a bite of that nice apple.</p><p>So I make a quick check of Yelp—these ribs better be quality ribs—and run out to the recommended rib joint on River Street named “Coast Cafe” and make my purchase: three whole pork BBQ ribs with a side of collard greens and string beans (to be healthy). When my order comes, it comes nestled in a styrofoam box, embraced by two pieces of aluminum foil. The heat sweats through the box and the plastic happy face’d bag.<span id=\"more-1479\"></span></p><p>When the box pops open, there it is: the meat tar glistening, fat smacking, heaven smelling rack of ribs that’s been waiting in the promised land.</p><p>Comfort food has existed for at least as long as fire and probably before (Mongol warriors stored raw mutton meat under their saddles as a quick pick-me-up snack—and invented steak tartare. Not long after came the chopped steak, and then the hamburger).</p><p>But what makes comfort food so comforting? Is it their hit-all combination of fat, sugar, and salt? Is it their connection with childhood memories? Louis Szathmary, the late Hungarian-American celebrity chef, theorized that men love hamburgers because the buns remind them of the maternal bosom. Whatever the “it” factor, we all recognize and are drawn to cues such as the sizzle of meat, the crackling of fries in oil, the sweetness of cream, and the carb-y heft of bread.</p><p>More interesting, however, is the question of what comfort food, well, comforts. The pure physical reasons we are drawn to comfort food involves its nutritional makeup. We crave carbs and fat as our body’s most readily used form of energy. It’s no coincidence that ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs)—products meant to treat severe malnutrition—often contain calorie dense peanuts, whole milk, and sugar.</p><p>Perhaps it is also not a coincidence Colonel (Harland) Sanders began doling out fried chicken dinners in front of a gas station in Corbin, Kentucky during the Great Depression. By 1938, Sanders went so far as to sponsor “relief banquets” for families on welfare; one imagines his chicken featured prominently. And then there are advertisements hawking products such as ice cream and french fries, screaming their ability to make people happy, loved, or even sexy. Something about comfort food goes deeper than mere bones and muscles.</p><p>The city of Cambridge’s great proliferation of educational institutions often mask the fact that it is a real city with residents who aren’t temporary collegiate settlers, and that the only available food isn’t from wood-paneled college dining halls. To dig deeper into the true meaning of comfort food in this city, we must venture beyond salad bars and serving trays and into the messy, gritty streets. As of 2012, 14.4% of all persons and 9.9% of families in Cambridge live below the poverty line. Historically, many of these people lived in an area known as “Area Four” (formerly a landfill), bordered on the north by Hampshire Street, on the south by Massachusetts Avenue, on the west by Prospect Street, and on the east by the Grand Junction Railroad tracks.</p><p>Coast Cafe, the Yelp-recommended rib joint, is located in Area Four. The “Coast” in the name refers to a now little-known moniker for the southern half of Area Four. No one is sure how Area Four got this nickname. Perhaps it is because the area bordered the Charles River. Or perhaps it is an ironic allusion to the upper crust East Coast college kids next door. One may never know the origin of the name, but perhaps we may guess at the origin of the food.</p><p>Boiled down to the bare bones, comfort food is poor man’s food—in all cultures. Cheap, easy-to-make, and above all, filling, dishes ranging from macaroni and cheese to meatloaf to fried rice both warmed the body and allowed thrifty cooks to use scraps from previous meals. Emotional connotations would have been quick to follow. Fullness equaled security. Security equaled comfort equaled love. Perhaps Szathmary’s assertions about the maternal bosom aren’t so farfetched; after all, the most idyllic childhood memories are centered around baking a warm, yeasty loaf of bread with mom.</p><p>Perhaps comfort food can never be fully explained. Its essence encompasses a myriad of textures and tastes: fat, salt, sugar, umami, creamy, slippery. It feeds all of our primal needs. But there is that mysterious way in which mere food—made of dead (or nearly dead) ingredients—can so easily transcend the physical and deeply affect the social and emotional realm. What happens in between?</p><p>That’s something to think about. But at the moment, my ape brain is wholly occupied by the steaming meal in front of me. I gnaw on the ribs, holding the ends with my bare hands. The thick meat sticks nicely between my teeth, the tendons crackle, and the syrupy barbecue glaze slithers between my lips. And the only word I think, or rather feel, is content.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

On one snowless December night, the moment arrived, fairytale-like, just before midnight. The last spoonful of salsa scooped, my coat buttoned, the hostess thanked, my exit was only halted by the call of one or two (gender-neutral) princes—“We have to discuss <em>Serial</em>!”<span id=\"more-1536\"></span></p><p>There was nothing to do but stay and form a small circle of devotees, where every half-hearted change of subject could be punctured by a brief, “But what about the Nisha call?” Midnight passed without notice as we looked to a date five days hence.</p><p>“If she ends it with another meditation on epistemology, I swear,” one partygoer scoffed, implying that if Sarah Koenig did not reveal precisely <em>whodunit</em>, she’d meet a fate worse than Leakin Park.</p><p>My friend was not alone in his demand for a satisfying series finale. <em>Slate </em>podcaster Mike Pesca (podcasting about a podcast) echoed his statement with a stern warning to Koenig: “Don’t let this be a contemplation on the nature of truth.” The humor site funnyordie.com released a viral parody where a desperate Koenig gives in to her audience’s need for answers by confessing that she committed the murder herself.</p><p>“I do podcasts,” the parody-Koenig pleads on air, “It was supposed to be for four people. Do you think if I thought this was going to be anything I would have had MailChimp sponsor it?”</p><p>And, of course, <em>Serial </em>was something — the most popular podcast ever, reaching five million downloads on iTunes, inspiring an <em>SNL </em>parody, and infiltrating small talk everywhere. It was the podcast that launched a thousand subreddits.</p><p>What made <em>Serial</em> so popular? To answer this question, we might take a cue from Koenig and consider a timeline. It spans a little over a month, November 20<sup>th</sup> to December 11<sup>th</sup>, twenty-two days and three serial episodes. Between the airing of those episodes, two police officers avoided indictment for the killing of two unarmed black men, <em>Rolling Stone </em>apologized for inaccuracy in its story about a brutal gang-rape, and the Senate released a report revealing C.I.A. torture tactics in the wake of 9/11.</p><p>Five million listeners longing to have faith in Sarah Koenig; a nation losing faith in its police force, its justice system, its media, its government.</p><p>In the first episode of <em>Serial</em>, Koenig wryly notes that her true-crime tale has an air of epic tragedy. “On paper, the case was like a Shakespearean mash-up,” she narrates, “young lovers from different worlds thwarting their families, secret assignations, jealousy, suspicion, and honor besmirched.” The show’s medium, serialized broadcasts, inspires nostalgia for a slightly more recent time—the era of radio, the fireside chat, the authority of a deep distant voice. And, with that authority, faith in truth and justice.</p><p>But for all their nostalgia, for all the faith they longed to have in Koenig’s distant voice, today’s media-weary <em>Serial </em>fans could not resist taking matters into their own keyboard-cramped hands. The hard-boiled detective posts on Reddit from his basement “office;” his femme fatale calls herself Sprinkles1. The <em>Serial </em>forums on the site range from obscure, dug-up facts (“Jay’s lawyer specialized in animal law” says seriallysurreal) to conspiracy theories (“A drug dealer did it,” Sprinkles insists) to confirmations and refutations of Koenig’s least significant statements (“The Crab Crib: shrimp sale confirmed,” daveaflav assures us).</p><p>Squeebeaux has posted a comprehensive list of maps, videos and images, ranging from a hand-drawn timeline of Jay’s testimony to a satellite map of the all-important Best Buy to a video of the fallen tree that covered Hae’s body in Leakin Park. In <em>Serial’s </em>consumption, nostalgia for the authority of the radio age competes with the realities of the Internet age, where every user can assume his own authority.</p><p>Of course, amateur authority is often misleading, and some times just plain libelous. One post, titled “Could Jay’s Father be Involved?,” claims to have discovered Jay’s criminal record. As the post’s author acknowledges, Mr. Wilds never appears on the show—save for a brief mention of  “an older man” who answered Jay’s phone.</p><p>The fan approach to <em>Serial </em>is indicative of a larger Internet-enabled approach to news. AMAthon comments on a pre-finale <em>Serial </em>thread, “We’re only two days away from Find the Boston Bombers, part two.” In spring 2013, a massive community of Reddit users identified and accused a Muslim man named Sunil Tripathi of launching the Boston Marathan attack; when police arrested the real terrorists, they issued an apology. Another Internet suspect, a 17-year-old boy Redditors called “Blue Robe Man,” attracted attention because a video showed his shoulder-bag sagging The search for the bombers saw a renewed faith in law enforcement, but this faith was not enough to deter citizens from trying to enforce the law themselves.</p><p>Forget Hae’s murderer. It is 2015, and we are all on trial.</p><p>In the pre-Reddit age, one entertainment broadcast made almost as many headlines as <em>Serial. War of the Worlds, </em>the Orson Welles broadcast of a sci-fi story of an Earth besieged by Martians, aired in the format of a news story on October 30, 1938. The front page story of the <em>Times </em>the next day read, “Radio Listeners in Panic, Taking War Drama as Fact.” It describes the “wave of mass hysteria” that ensued, traffic jams and clogged telephone lines. In Newark, the newspaper reports, doctors administered shock treatment to fifteen listeners hospitalized. While some listeners called the <em>Times </em>for information, others didn’t wait for the fact-check. In New York, a throng of playgoers rushed out of their seats when a man’s radio-listening wife called the house. The manager had quite literally shouted “Fire!” in a crowded theater.</p><p>Desperately trying to persuade listeners not to flee the city, local police officers sent out radio broadcasts and the <em>AP </em>assured the public that the alien attack was mere  “studio dramatization.”  With the technology of the times, these statements only reached a few, and they could hardly challenge the authority of Welles’s own news-bulletin. Indeed, Welles copied the “first-hand report” radio style pioneered by Herbert Morrison in his coverage of the Hindenburg disaster.</p><p>Recently, though, historians Jefferson Pooley and Michael Socolow have argued that the broadcast did not, in fact, cause wide-scale panic; rather, they claim, print newspapers amplified the broadcast’s effect to “wage war on radio.” While pre-broadcast surveys showed only 5,000 tuned to Welles’s channel, as the story of “mass hysteria” spread, thousands more claimed to have been victims of that hysteria themselves.</p><p>Other historians stand by the original story. The investigation, in any case, did not come until 2013. Whether Americans in 1938 were incited to panic by a broadcast or incited to fake panic by reports of a broadcast, no one did any fact-checking, then.</p><p>However, radio was not always categorized by singular authority.. There were no laws or regulations restricting amateur radio broadcasters—the Reddit users of yore—until 1912. At one point, 3,000 hams belonged to the free “Wireless Association of America.” Though Congress eventually limited most users to a wavelength of 200 meters, it did not ban their stations. Selected amateurs could receive special licenses for better wavelengths. Some of them went, so to speak, viral.</p><p>When America entered World War I, amateurs feared that they’d be shut down, for the 1912 Radio Act gave the President permission to close stations during wartime. Although the Navy banned amateur transmissions in the West for a few months during the war, some newspaper commentators believed that hams could help the war effort. A 1916 San Francisco <em>Chronicle </em>Op-Ed titled “20,000 American Watchdogs” promised that “the wireless man” was essential to quick communication when closed telegraph and telephone lines isolated sections of the country. The author insists, “if France or Belgium had possessed an affective amateur wireless scout service, there might possibly be a different story to tell today.”  Like the well-intentioned but ultimately misguided Boston Bombing sleuthers, Americans thought multiple eyes—and voices—could provide the key to truth.</p><p>Not until the development of public address systems, long-distance telephone lines, and vacuum-tube radio transmitters did national radio coverage become possible. The American Telegraph Company proposed a system that would use telephone wires to link radio systems together. By the 1930’s, three networks dominated U.S. broadcasting: the Red and Blue divisions of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and the Columbia Broadcasting System. It was CBS that inspired that “mass hysteria” with its broadcast of <em>War of the Worlds.</em></p><p>In the 1950’s and 60’s, with the growing popularity of television, the commercial radio industry began to decline. In its wake, President Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act to encourage “the growth and development of non-commercial radio;” NPR, which produces <em>Serial, </em>attributes its creation to this law.</p><p>Today, besides satellite-delivered radio, NPR produces a number of podcasts. Radio-style shows can be created by anyone with a PC. In his 2005 essay “Will the Podcast Kill the Radio Star?” Richard Berry notes that with the advent of the podcast, “audiences are producers… audiences, cut off from traditional media, rediscover their voices.” Unlike radio amateurs at the turn of the century, podcasters can reach subscribers around the world.</p><p>Today’s deep distant voice can belong to anyone. It inspires other voices, in Twitter comments and Reddit forums. While constant fact checking prevents the average Internet-user from fooling the world into believing it’s under alien attack, <em>Serial </em>has shown us that amateur authority can inspire a “mass hysteria” of a different sort.</p><p>The paradox of <em>Serial </em>rises out of historically shifting attitudes toward media authority. Since its conception, audio broadcasting has swung on a pendulum between democratization and centralization, monopoly and the rule of the masses. The American audience has longed, at turns, for both; it has had faith in the distant voice and it has voiced its own truth. In our plea for Sarah Koenig to provide a satisfying conclusion to <em>Serial, </em>we express our deep-rooted need to trust an authority with the answers. In our subreddits and speculation, we express the need, equally great, to find our own truth.</p>",

		"body" : "<p>The air conditioner was broken in my tiny room at the Smile Hotel. Even two hundred miles north of Tokyo, the late-July heat could smother you if you asked.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">*</p><p>By day, I left my room to work for the two people I worked for. By night, I went to dinner with the two people I worked for before returning to my room. They were paying my expenses and gave me a small stipend, for which I was grateful, et cetera.</p><p>One night I left dinner early and not undramatically. It’s difficult to faze me, but once I am fazed I tend to stay fuming, the offender’s existence becoming a personal affront to my own. I ran back to my room and, sweltering, stripped naked in the six-inch wide strip of floor space between desk and bed. I looked to my right, into the mirror above the desk that extended nine inches from the wall on a good day. I wanted to see a face blistered with anger, scorched with fury. But the yellow light of the room had soaked into my skin. My features were razed the way <i>purikura </i>makes eyes bigger, limbs thinner, skin smoother until each person who steps into the photobooth walks out looking like the one that came before. My likeness said <i>arigatou gozaimasu! </i>like everyone said to everyone else.</p><p><span id=\"more-384\"></span></p><p>I flung myself prone on the bed. It didn’t give, so it hurt, refusing me the solace of sleep. The door and opposing window wanted to kiss and crush me lengthwise. The sheets, already damp with sweat, wanted to drown or hang me—they had yet to decide. I opened the lusty window, but what played outside was equally churlish. The fumes of <i>yakitori </i>snaked through my window, seeping into whatever space had been left for me.</p><p>Jaundiced, tense, and hot, I called my boyfriend, who was lounging somewhere between Greece and the Canary Islands. He didn’t pick up but I spoke to him anyway and left my laptop open on my bed just in case he might Skype me back. I put my moist right cheek on the keyboard: the finger grease of years past seemed safer than the buckwheat bean-filled pillow in cahoots with the sheets.</p><p>I heard a knock on the door but didn’t rise to open it. The man I worked for appeared anyway on the flimsy desk, sitting with his legs wide open. He was also naked and sweating. I closed my eyes but that changed nothing. He methodically swept the circumference of his nostrils with his left pinky, drinking his <i>shiro</i> wine straight out of the bottle. He used my hotel phone to make a call in Japanese. He inflated, loomed larger with each sip of wine. When the conversation was over, his head was touching the eight-foot tall ceiling and his belly nearly reached the opposite wall. He slammed the hotel phone back onto the cradle and continued to swill and swell.</p><p>The hotel phone rang. The man tossed it to me. I grasped it with my clammy hands, unspeaking. I heard the man’s voice through the receiver, apologizing, maybe. I hurled the phone through the open window, managing to avoid the large body in the tiny room. The telephone cord wrapped me up and tied me tight to the base. Led by the receiver and held by the cord and cradle of the hotel phone, I slipped out the window and down four flights. We landed on the bonsai tree outside the flower shop that was only open on Sundays.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">*</p><p>The Smile Hotel shared its lobby with a 7/11 where I sometimes bought chocolate and whiskey. I didn’t deduct from my stipend to buy them, but sometimes I wish I had.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

		"body" : "<p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">When Robert Kennedy announces at a campaign stop in Indiana that Martin Luther King, Jr. has been assassinated, the crowd lets out a collective scream. I’m viewing a film of the 1968 speech on a late October afternoon in seminar, leaning forward to watch Kennedy’s grainy image. This particular class is about Black liberation movements and canon formation, and we’ve been watching clips of civil rights rhetoric for an hour now. We’re trying to figure out how the living, swelling voices of Black leaders—people previously pushed to the cracks of American culture—can assume the aesthetic authority of a literary novel or anthologized poem. Watching the moment at the peak of the 2012 election season, it feels particularly charged.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">At one point in the speech, Kennedy quotes a line from Aeschylus. As I watch Kennedy grope for the words, the moment shivers through me. Kennedy cites the tragedian as his favorite poet, then pauses, muttering something to himself, maybe mouthing the Greek before pushing its dactyls into the fat marbles of English. His crisp New England clip ripples over the crowd:</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">“And even in our sleep, pain that cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, and in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of God.</span>”</p><p><span id=\"more-302\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">It’s a moment of intense emotional impact. It’s also a reminder of how the rhetorical register of American political elites has changed. Kennedy gives his speech in response to King’s death—needless to say, an extraordinarily difficult circumstance—yet it’s hard to imagine a contemporary politician quoting Aeschylus at all, even at a similar moment. While perhaps in keeping with the tone of a Harvard man’s 1968 presidential bid, Kennedy speaks with a set of references not evinced on the 2012 campaign trail, where colloquialism and popular allusion rule the day. The title of an August 2012 online <i>Time </i>article proclaims “Obama’s Soaring Rhetoric” to be “A Bright Shining Lie”; Vice President Joe Biden uses and misuses the word “literally” in his DNC speech with the frequency of an animated teenager.  Certainly, politicians these days don’t quote Greek poetry. Hearing Kennedy’s speech in late October, a time awash with the frantic punditry of political commentators, I’m struck by the range of rhetoric that somehow forms a culture—from Aeschylus to the sound bites of a Facebook newsfeed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;\">But when he quotes Aeschylus, Kennedy isn’t talking about abstractions. He is talking about the death of a real man who breathed and believed things; he is groping to find words fit for the scope of a real and immense tragedy, translating not only Greek to English, but loss to language. At a scale this large, with actors this influential, register holds power. Kennedy’s spontaneous eulogy, his dip into the register of intellectual tradition, is an acknowledgment that King has a sanctioned place in the canon of Official History—a history written by rich white men schooled in dead languages. At the same time, the speech acknowledges a renegotiation of who precisely authors this history, and who has the power to enter it. The call to antiquity is not a pivotal baptism canonizing King as public saint: fitting as the words are, King doesn’t need their permission. He walked into history without ever having been invited. </span></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

		"body" : "<p><em>The history of photography in the Harvard Advocate is an ongoing and rich one, a confrontation of the enduring question: How does the image find its place in a literary magazine? To commemorate the launch of The Harvard Advocate’s Winter 2013 issue, “Origin,” we have traced the emergence and changing role of the image in the Advocate and the ways in which the photographic image has been read on the page.</em></p><p>Although photography had emerged in print in the early twentieth century, photographs only first began to appear in the magazine during the fifties and sixties as illustrative content and as advertisements.  A portrait of T.S. Eliot was included in the centennial issue, used as a visual reference to one of the<i> Advocate’</i>s most esteemed alumni. All of these examples speak to the then secondary, supplementary nature of visual media to the magazine.</p><p><span id=\"more-708\"></span></p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/02_advertisement.jpg\"><img alt=\"02_advertisement\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-709\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/02_advertisement.jpg?w=670\"/></a></p><p>Yet even at this point, photographs were quietly gaining more momentum, energy, and impact.  Photos were featured alongside interviews with literary luminaries such as John Berryman (published in the Spring 1969 issue) and Conrad Aiken (published in the October 1970 issue).</p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/04_conrad-aiken-photo-reel.jpg\"><img alt=\"04_conrad aiken photo reel\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-710\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/04_conrad-aiken-photo-reel.jpg?w=670\"/></a></p><p>This particular spread of this October 1970 issue marked a particular moment in the institutional use of the photograph in the<i> Advocate</i>, as the image was now distinguished from the content it had been informing. On this page, the film reel vertically flanks the text of the interview with Aiken. With the sprockets visible, the set of pictures remains raw, and the seriality of the portraits lends a new agency to the photograph, which now tells a story of its own. Rather than being edited, this printed film negative bares it all, without attempting to hide what wasn’t used. Instead, this image embraces the processes that both interviews and photography require.</p><p>These years, between the late ‘60s and early ‘70s, marked a radical transformation in the use of visual media in the<i> Advocate</i>. Photographs began to be published more frequently, though they still often remained as supplemental material. The photographic image had seldom existed by itself. “The Symbol,” published in the Fall 1968 issue, can be seen as the turning point that gave photographs their own voice in the magazine.</p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/05_the-symbol.jpg\"><img alt=\"05_the symbol\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-711\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/05_the-symbol.jpg?w=670\"/></a></p><p>“The Symbol,” a reproduction of a collage of pasted text, was one of the very first images printed on its own without any captioned text. Here, the text becomes the image—the text is the image. The two media coexist and mutually enhance each other, as photography becomes the vehicle through which the poem is reproduced and published. Photography acts as the means for reproduction of a poem of visual ontology. Poetry had prompted the publication of the photograph as a form of its own craft.</p><p>This piece speaks to the growing importance and centrality of photography to the magazine.  The Vietnam War and the revolutionary voice and spirit of student counter-culture of the ‘60s and ‘70s set the mood for the shifting direction of the magazine. James Atlas, 1968 president of the<i> Advocate</i> and current chairman of the Board of Trustees, chuckled as he remembered photographic media emerging in the pages of the magazine. Atlas recalled one particularly edgy photographic cover published in February 1970, describing it as the “nude backside of a woman, that’s a good name for that.”</p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_3067-version-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_3067 - Version 2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-712\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_3067-version-2.jpg?w=670\"/></a></p><p>Moving on from such levity, Atlas took time to reflect upon the larger role that photographs played during his tenure on the<i> Advocate</i>. His time in college took place within a context of social radicalism, Atlas remembered: “One of the powerful motivations was to be scandalous, not intellectually provocative.” Through the increased inclusion of visual media, he hoped “to somehow have the<i> Advocate,</i> for all its endearing stuffiness, reflect what was happening outside our windows, quite literally.”</p><p>In a literary magazine, the focus often lies on the words. Text tends to frame images, through captioning, explaining, and contextualizing. The then-racy 1970 cover of the magazine of the bare backside of a woman speaks to the ways in which the photographic image can color how something is read.</p><p>Beginning with the renegade spirit that helped photographs gain steady footing as an integral part of the publication, visual media in the<i> Advocate</i> have since continued to evolve. They remain a part of the rich artistic tradition that the magazine continues to publish today. In the Winter 2013 “Origin” issue, “Ellen’s Gift” is a parafiction, a photo essay that operates in the space between fiction and reality, that poses as if it documented the story of a real woman. Current photographs in the <i>Advocate</i> have found their contemporary edge.</p><p>In meditating upon visual media in the <i>Magazine</i>, it seems only fitting to honor 1932 president James Agee, renowned American art critic and media theorist. In 1972, a commemorative issue to James Agee was published that highlighted his theoretical works on visual media.</p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/06_james-agee.jpg\"><img alt=\"06_james agee\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-713\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/06_james-agee.jpg?w=670\"/></a></p><p>Photography at the time was still relatively new in the <i>Advocate</i>’s institutional memory. Agee had written extensively about the photograph and the ways in which the viewer comes to appreciate its meaning. In reference to a Walker Evans photograph, taken when he was writing <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i>, Agee writes about the struggle of verbally discussing and analyzing photographs. For him, “The whole problem, if [he] were trying fully to embody the house, would be to tell of it exactly in its ordinary terms.” To caption a photo limits the photograph’s possibility, reducing it explicitly to a lowest common denominator; something is inevitably lost. An ineffable photographic effect remains that cannot be put down on paper.</p><p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/07_house-walker-evans.jpg\"><img alt=\"07_house walker evans\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-714\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/07_house-walker-evans.jpg?w=670\"/></a></p><p>Agee’s discussion exposes the underlying irony of any analytical exploration of photographic material. This short piece serves as a footnote to photographic highlights of the past. But perhaps, this series of ‘explanations’ dilutes the possible potency of visual media in the<i> Advocate </i>itself.</p><p>Is a picture worth a thousand words? Or should a picture simply leave us speechless?</p><p>Let us blink, and with fresh eyes, savor the silence.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

At about this time the viewer thinks, “I’m right there with ya, Doc.”<span id=\"more-1626\"></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Paul Thomas Anderson’s adaptation of Pynchon’s <i>Inherent Vice</i>, stays true its source… what that means is the plot is<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>winding, disorienting, and labyrinthine, supersaturated with one-liners and surrealist gags. It is a unique, albeit polarizing, experience. Anderson’s undertaking is certainly bold and <i>Inherent Vice </i>is not without its critics, who claim the film is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/01/inherent-vice-review-mark-kermode\"><span class=\"s2\">languid at best</span></a> and <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2014/10/05/inherent-vice-an-oscar-non-starter/\"><span class=\"s2\">incoherent at worst</span></a>. Such criticisms may say more about the viewer than the film itself. <i>Inherent Vice</i> is certainly not for the lover of clean endings, nor for those who rely on linear narratives as a crutch. For the optimal experience, the viewer must be willing to look beyond coherence and to be subsumed by the fog. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The story begins as they often do: with a woman and a problem. Shasta Fey Hepworth, Doc’s slinky ex-girlfriend, drifts into his house, in need of another favor. This time, Shasta’s been messing around with Mickey Wolfman, a shady real estate tycoon. Mickey’s wife has a beau on the side, and they are scheming to send Wolfman to the loony bin and make off with his fortune. Doc, a private detective by profession, walks Shasta back to her car, promising to look into it. Next thing Doc knows, he wakes up encircled by the LAPD, with an anonymous corpse lying beside him. The ensuing investigation brings Doc into contact with an array of outrageous characters, including members of the Aryan brotherhood, a surf-rock saxophonist who works undercover for the government (Owen Wilson), a coke-dealing dentist, and Bigfoot, an LAPD straight-man who eats chocolate covered bananas in a homoerotic fashion. No one wants to cooperate, and everyone is hiding something. As lies, marijuana haze, and spooky synchronicities thin the veil between the real and the unreal, the indistinguishable mix of portends and paranoia sends Doc further down the rabbit-hole until, finally, he has become an arm of a conspiracy he cannot even comprehend.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">“<i>Inherent Vice</i>”, the sultry voice of Sortilège (played by Joanna Newsome) explains, “<i>is anything you can’t avoid.</i>” In the film, the definition is cited in reference to the torch Doc carries for Shasta. The title takes on a broader meaning in reference to the Golden Fang, the seemingly inescapable conspiracy which lies at the heart of the Wolfman mystery. The Fang boggles the mind in its totality. The Golden Fang is not only an importer of high-quality opiates, but also the head of a chain of luxury rehab facilities. The youth of America are sold their own rebellion, told to “turn on, tune in, drop out” with drugs and hippiedom, and are immediately sold its cure, New Age spirituality in the guise of Manson-esque recovery cults. The conspiracy supplies its own demand, a perfect perpetual motion device with ruined lives turning the cogs. This is best exemplified in the damage done to one’s teeth from prolonged heroin use: “it sucks the calcium right out of ya”. The Fang has even controlled for this, incorporating a sketchy conglomerate of dentists to clean up after the damage is done. It is a totalizing system, one in which even the U.S. Government has a stake. The extent of the Golden Fang is parodied in the film’s final scenes. Doc must execute a drug exchange with operatives of the Fang, who turn out to be a stereotypical suburban family. Even the Joneses down the street are in on the plot. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The technical definition of “Inherent Vice” reads: “a hidden defect of a good or property which of itself is the cause of, or contributes to, its deterioration, damage, or wastage.” <i>Inherent Vice </i>does not merely, as some critics claim, send counter-culture off into the fading sunset of the sixties.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><i>Inherent Vice </i>is not a funeral; it’s an autopsy. The Golden Fang (and the film as a whole) diagnoses the ‘hidden defect’ that led to the demise of hippie-dom. Counter-culture is a pipe-dream. By its own terms, it exists as a negation of something more actualized and sustainable. Like a parasite, counter-culture attacked America with the vague, nihilistic notion of negating everything society had stood for in order to build something better anew, but it could not live without its host. The Golden Fang suggests that this host was capable of co-opting its parasite, transforming hippie-dom into something which could be subsumed by the mainstream. If you can be sold your own rebellion as a commodity, then there is no rebellion, especially if you can be sold the rehabilitation <i>from</i> your rebellion. In 2015, the Orwellian nature of the Golden Fang ought to hit close to home. After the Snowden leaks, the world itself has become Pynchonized: the totalizing conspiracy expressed by the Golden Fang is a mere tease compared to the NSA’s digital panopticon. There is no safe place, no counter-culture impervious to the host’s immune system. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">These are dizzyingly complex ideas that Pynchon plays with, and if the viewer finds <i>Inherent Vice </i>to be confusing or disorienting, it is doing its job. The film succeeds in that it perfectly captures the experience of discovering a conspiracy. The twists and turns, disjoints and inconsistencies create a viewing experience which echoes what is onscreen. The form could not possibly be more suited to the content. Doc’s investigation swallows him whole in a psychedelic inversion of reality. Just so, the viewer is swept in by <i>Inherent Vice</i>, and swirled about by its meandering plot and superfluity of detail. The aforementioned Harbor scene is thus the films aesthetic epicenter, in which the feelings of the audience are mirrored perfectly by Doc’s onscreen sentiments.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The viewer is almost implicated in the action as the conspiracy unfolds both around and within Doc, subsuming him in its totalizing wake. Doc’s investigation into the Golden Fang has a way of incorporating him into its operation, making him implicit. As the conspiracy unfolds it becomes impossible for Doc to parse from within because, like a bad acid trip, the distortion is only visible from the outside. However, for the viewer, who has a degree of separation from the events, there is hope. The possibility of multiple re-watches allows the audience to be the detective Doc cannot be. <i>Inherent Vice </i>is not impenetrable; the astute viewer can build coherence from the cacophony. However, the first viewing is unique in that it offers viewers the chance to wander alongside Doc in the fog. To exacerbate this echo effect, try lighting up each time Doc does. See how long you last.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><em>by Rachael Smith ’16</em></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"407\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/BTRMkQzFYHI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"670\"></iframe></span></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

In part one, the group discussed Seresin’s</span> <span class=\"s1\">“A Love Letter to My Stepmom”</span> <span class=\"s1\">and Scherlis’</span> <span class=\"s1\">“Their Party.”</span> <span class=\"s1\">In the abridged transcription below, the group discusses Zhang’s “Full Circle: (Exotic) Odysseys Through (Oriental) Rainforests on (Outlawed) Tour Buses,” Lewis’</span> <span class=\"s1\">“When the Mammy Sphinx Gawks Back at You!”.</span><span id=\"more-1672\"></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Caleb Lewis: I think out of all of our pieces it is Faye’s, “Full Circle: (Exotic) Odysseys Through (Oriental) Rainforests on (Outlawed) Tour Buses,” that deals the least explicitly with the theme of possession. However, I do see the thread running through the piece in subtler ways. Faye, would you mind speaking about your piece through the lens of possession?</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Faye Yan Zhang: I found material possession very interesting. My piece is about traveling through China’s Yunnan province. In particular, it is about the very touristy area of Xishuangbanna, which some people have taken as a pun to mean “twenty dollars,”</span> <span class=\"s1\">because “shuang”</span><b> </b><span class=\"s1\">means, “twice.”</span> <span class=\"s1\">I found that tourism aspect very interesting. What struck me the most was how Buddhism is very commodified, all over China, but in that area in particular. A lot of people are Buddhist in the province and it’s home to a lot of ethnic minorities. In some ways, Buddhism has become a bit of a theme park. People in the United States think of it as very spiritual, very concerned with giving things up, but when we went to Xishuangbanna, we went to a Buddhist temple and it was basically like a theme park. It was built on a hill, and on the top of the hill there was a gigantic golden statue of Buddha. It was actually made out of plaster and painted gold. There were different levels on the hill and there was a different temple on each level. In each temple there was a different attraction. People tried to sell you things, and tried to get you to donate. On one level there was sacred tree where you could pay twenty dollars to hang your name on the tree and be guaranteed salvation for you and your family. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There was an interesting painting in one of the main temples near the top. It was a large space and inside there was a giant statue of the Buddha. Around the back there were these floor to ceiling paintings depicting the life of Buddha. They were really strange, almost psychedelic. There were flying spaceships in one of them and all sorts of vibrant colors and shapes. I went around to the back of the Buddha and there was a giant face of a demon. I remember being interested as to why that was, why the artist chose to do that. It felt to me as if the demon was possessing the Buddha from behind, which reminded me a lot of the commodification of the religion in general.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Indiana Seresin: What I loved so much about your piece, Faye, was that it complicated the binary between commodification and spirituality, or authenticity and inauthenticity especially in a traveling context. A lot of travel writing will come from a privileged western position, and a lot of it is striving towards this weird ethereal, authentic experience, which of course is completely inaccessible to anyone with money coming from the west. I thought the way that it disrupted that question of authenticity was great. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It also brought Los Angeles to mind. My dad lives in LA and I think LA is a prime example of a place that’s so deeply committed to spirituality on its face. There are so many stores that sell incense and very vague symbols of Buddhism and other Eastern religions. I think that vagueness covers up what in your piece is so obviously commodification. The vagueness shows that it’s even more commodified because there’s nothing substantial beneath it.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Julian Lucas: In your piece, Faye, you describe how the Han Chinese ethnic group owns most of the property in the region that you traveled to. It made me wonder how going there and trying to have an authentic experience of the culture was effected by that outside possession of the space.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">FYZ: In my piece I talk about how the main non-Han ethnic group in Xishuangbanna are the Dai people, and just like there are Buddhism theme parks, there are Dai theme parks where you can go in an tour an authentic Dai village.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">JL: With people living there? Are they actually called theme parks?</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">FYZ: They aren’t, they market themselves as completely authentic: like they’re real people who live there all the time and that the village has been preserved throughout the years. But they’re not, they’re lying to you. Those houses have been built in the last five or ten years capitalizing on tourism. The people who live there are ethnic Dai people, but they’re earning money by bringing Han people into their homes, almost like a road show or a spectacle. And I don’t know if its completely wrong for them to do that, it is their livelihood and how they make their livings.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">JL: All three of you—Caleb, Faye, and Lily—wrote pieces about who owns a certain spectorial space.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Lily talks about entering this vodou space, and wondering if westerners are allowed, Faye talks about the Han entering a Dai minority space, and Caleb, you talk about trying to take back an artistic space that’s been defined by the white gaze. It’s interesting to me that all three of you dealt with that: experiencing a place based on who owns that place.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">CL: I also saw some connections, especially between my piece and Faye’s. On the face at least, we both deal with spaces that are inhabited by a minority but are controlled by a majority. In my piece I considered Kara Walker’s Marvelous Sugar Baby exhibit, and thought a lot about how many of the problems that I saw with the reception of the piece came in the form of people wanting to go and look and possess, but not being willing to let themselves be possessed by the art. What I mean by that is they were looking to enjoy and critique art but not willing to engage critically with themselves as a result of it. They weren’t willing to let the art “see”</span> <span class=\"s1\">them. I think that’s something that happens quite a bit when you have art that stems from a long history of marginalization and oppression. It’s hard to get people to finally bring it in from the margins and take it seriously, and think about themselves and their culpability in relation to the long history that it represents. So in the end, I argue that we, conscious art lovers, need to give those pieces eyes, “oppositional gazes,”</span> <span class=\"s1\">to borrow phrase from the writer bell hooks, that allow them to look privilege in the eyes.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">IS: It’s interesting that you framed that sort of engagement as being possessed: not wanting to confront what these pieces are really saying is not wanting to be possessed. In some ways that’s antithetical to what may be the obvious way of thinking about possession, but it’s interesting because I think that’s the form of possession that’s very much at play in Lily’s piece, which is letting go, getting outside the ego, and allowing your consciousness to be impacted by something that’s in front of you. That’s something that art would ideally do, especially art made by people in the margins, by people whose voices you aren’t going to be confronting everyday. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">FYZ: I like these two ideas of possession that we’re playing with. In my mind, one of the types of possession, which may be the kind that Indiana and Lily talk about is like putting your hand in a glove and fully embodying something, but the other type of possession is casting a net over something without embodying it. That’s what happens in my piece and Caleb’s piece.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lily Scherlis: In either one, the result is the same. You still gain control over something, just via the inside or the outside.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">JL: I’m thinking about the title of your piece, Caleb, “When the Mammy Sphinx Gawks Back at You!”</span> <span class=\"s1\">and the whole idea of the oppositional gaze and the art not being looked at, but illuminating the spectators. We have a Kara Walker painting in the issue that I put next to your piece; it’s called “Dreams Herself Into Being.”</span> <span class=\"s1\">In the painting, the form of the sphinx is just blank canvas and everything else around it is illuminated by that brightness.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">CL: I talked a little about that idea in the piece, how I thought Walker’s decision to cast the sphinx in bright white refined sugar as opposed to molasses was very telling. When you walked into the dark space of the derelict factory and encountered this blinding white mammy figure, it was almost like a reversal of the social order, one that I thought was pretty explicit in demanding you think about what exactly she was illuminating. I think that was lost on people, that playing with light and darkness.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">JL: In the piece you mentioned Betye Saar and how she’s not a fan of Walker’s.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">CL: Not at all, she led a letter writing campaign back in the 90’s trying to get Walker’s work barred from museums and galleries.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">JL: You also mentioned Betye Saar’s piece, “The Liberation of Aunt Jemima,” another sort of stereotype-reclamation piece. It’s Aunt Jemima as warrior, essentially. So as two artists who deal with the repossession of stereotypical images, what do you think is the difference between Saar and Walker?</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">CL: I think especially among black artists who have seen a lot of success in the mainstream art world, there’s a lot of pressure to be triumphant. In my piece I quote James Baldwin who refers to Richard Wright as one of the only Negroes invited to the cocktail party of the white man’s world. I think that description is really telling. I think that aloneness in itself produces a lot of pressure to reflect well and be respectable.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">FYZ: You said be “triumphant?”</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">CL: Yes. So I grew up in Cincinnati, which is still a pretty racially segregated city—it definitely has its enclaves. I remember driving or walking through some of the black neighborhoods and seeing street vendors selling black art, but it was always of muscular men pulling themselves up on ladders or of women with long braids wearing the crown of Nefertiti. They were images that were very triumphant and very romantic and kind of propagandistic in a way. For the longest, that’s what I thought that art made by black people looked like. Because there’s so little</span> <span class=\"s1\">“positive”</span> <span class=\"s1\">black representation in our society, I think that being a black person who has the opportunity to create culture is to be a person who is under a lot of pressure to make that art explicitly “positive.”</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">FYZ: That’s interesting, your description of that art reminds me of Chinese communist era art.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">CL: Yeah it’s empowering, and I certainly understand why it’s something that a people who have been marginalized throughout history would want to see, but I think it can kind of boxes the genre in.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">None of this is to criticize artists who criticize Walker. I think a lot of this comes about as a result of a generational divide. Many of them may worked in a time when it was important as artists to affirm the basic humanity of black people in ways more explicit than what we see, need, and want today. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">IS: I also think that at all times, different people depending on their positionality feel more or less able or more or less willing to have a “fuck you I’m not playing to your terms,”</span> <span class=\"s1\">mentality, or feel like they need to first affirm their existence as a person. In some ways it seems sort of futile to say one way or another is better or worse because undoubtedly you need that radical push, you need that step beyond declaring that you have a right to be at the cocktail party. On the other hand, if someone is having the experience where they feel like they need to affirm their basic worth to keep making art and contributing and changing things, we can’t deny that either. You need them both.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">JL: I’m thinking about Caleb’s example of the street art. What we’re talking about seem to be two very different ways of playing by the rules, of recognizing the white gaze, so to speak. One way of doing that is creating the opposite of what it sees, like the street vendors, but the other, more dangerous, I would say more interesting but sometimes more negative way would be something like what Kara Walker is doing, which is supposed to reflect a warped version of what that gaze expects to see.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">IS: I think the issue also is that you have the author’s intentions and the piece’s intentions, and on the other hand you have audience reception which seems to work in opposition to what the piece seems to be saying. It feels like there are all these conflicting forces that there’s no way of having a simple binary of one type of work that’s playing by the terms of the oppressor and one that isn’t.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Transcribed by Caleb Lewis ’17</em></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

		"body" : "<p>Mamma Jean’s home is an apartment in the city. The apartment is in a high rise of rental condominiums overlooking the beach, two blocks from a retirement community. She bought it when her husband died, years ago, as a big fuck you to widowhood and college students on spring break. The furniture is sparse; a stationary bike fills the space where a couch would sit. The TV loops continuously with 1950s Olympic cycling.</p><p>It’s the place I go when I need to go some place else.</p><p>I spent summers there once I was old enough to clean up after myself. Between her morning cycling and her evening cycling, she’d load me into her PT Cruiser and play taxi. “Play” is the term I used. The term she used was “moonlight.” She’d park on the corner of the bus stop near the local college and wait for disappointed summer-school girls, away from home and unaccustomed to public transportation, left behind by the 36 to Ocean Terminal.</p><p><span id=\"more-58\"></span></p><p>“Optimize” she’d say, pulling around to a girl whose bag had dropped to her ankles, her hands on her knees.</p><p>After a few successful fares, she’d turn homeward. “Am I using you?” she’d ask. “Are you playing a pawn to my success?”</p><p>“Ask for ice cream,” she’d say. “And make me think it’s my idea.”</p><p>The weird thing is, she was old even then. Now she’s a relic. Mamma Jean is of the age where she can no longer sit with her knees above her waist.

Born in 13<sup>th</sup>-century Persia, he composed a wide variety of poems about the themes of sacred love, beauty, and the eternal longing to be united with the Divine. In addition to the </em>Masnavi<em>, his revered six-volume poem, Rumi is most famous for his </em>Divân-e Shams-e Tabrizi<em>, which includes over 3200 </em>ghazals<em>. </em></p><p><em>The </em>ghazal<em> is a form of traditional Persian poetry that is often compared to the Western sonnet, due to its strict formalistic requirements. In the original Farsi, a </em>ghazal<em> comprises five to fifteen couplets, each ending with a refrain, which first appears at the end of both lines of the first couplet. The final couplet usually includes a reference to the poet in the third person, communicating more directly with the reader. Unlike sonnets, however, each couplet remains independent in meaning—a poem in itself—united to the others only in its form, rhyme, and meter. This sonnet from </em>Divân-e Shams-e Tabrizi<em> is widely considered Rumi’s final composition, addressed to his son while on his deathbed in 1273.</em></p><p><span id=\"more-489\"></span></p><p><strong>Go place your head on the pillow, leave me be </strong></p><p>Go place your head on the pillow, leave me be,<br>\r\nAbandon me, the broken and afflicted night wanderer.<br>\r\nAlone, the waves of sorrow and I, from night to day;<br>\r\nIf you wish, come forgive me; if you wish, go forsake me.<br>\r\nEscape from me, lest you fall into this misery:<br>\r\nChoose the route of health; abandon the path of pain.<br>\r\nAlone, the water of my eyes and I, crouched in sorrow’s corner,<br>\r\nTurning one hundred watermills with these tears.</p><p>My Lover, He murders me, with a heart of granite<br>\r\nWhile none dare warn: consider the blood debt.<br>\r\nSince the King of Beauty owes no loyalty,<br>\r\nSallow with love, you wait and be loyal.<br>\r\nThere’s a sickness other than dying without remedy,<br>\r\nSo how should I say treat this sickness?<br>\r\nLast night I dreamt a sage in the alley of love;<br>\r\nWith his hand, he beckoned me to his side.<br>\r\nIf a dragon blocks the path, Love is the emerald<br>\r\nWhose brilliance will banish the dragon.</p><p>Enough!

Put your fingers on the line of your jaw under your ear, and now move them towards your nose a little. What you are touching under the skin — that tough tissue — those are salivary glands.</p><p>I didn’t know I had salivary glands either until I contracted an infection in Berlin that caused them to swell up like hard balloons. My friend got it first; we were having dinner in our small apartment when she lay down on the ground and stopped moving. We didn’t have a thermometer, so all I knew was that her forehead singed my fingers when I touched it, and that her eyes were kind of blank. But we were sixteen, invincible, broke, and living an adventure in a foreign city. We had no guide book, no Internet, and no knowledge of an equivalent to 911 (nor knowledge that 911 works anywhere). So we got in a cab and told the driver <em>Krankenhaus</em>, and he drove us away into the empty Sunday-night city.</p><p><span id=\"more-397\"></span>We pulled up at a deserted alley and the driver gave us a look. My friend’s leg felt like a radiator against mine. I didn’t know the word for ER, so I asked for the “quick room.” The driver only shrugged and repeated the fare.</p><p>This particular hospital in Berlin — I still don’t know its name or where it is in the city — looked like a university campus, or a private mental institution, and on this night at least, all the lights were out. My friend couldn’t walk much, so I left her in one place and ran around in the dark.</p><p>I encountered a strange person as I was running and, though I was not the delirious one, I still have a hard time convincing myself he was real. By this time I had remembered the word for ER and pleaded with him three or four times in German and once in English to tell me where it was. He only looked at me blankly, before mimicking me in a high-pitched squeal. Then he ran away.</p><p>It wasn’t long before I saw the glowing sign that read <em>Unfallstation</em>, an oasis in what had become my madness. I sprinted back to fetch my friend and within minutes we were sitting in front of two hypnotically calm German doctors. By this time her face had swelled up to around one and a half times its normal size, and the doctors sat for a while probing her chipmunk cheeks in silence, the only sound the quiet weeping of an old Turkish woman in the corridor. Eventually they prescribed her a medicine that drained us of our last euros. We spent the entirety of the next day lying in a public park, having been kicked out of our apartment at 9am and unable to afford anything else. Our flight — thank God — was scheduled for late that evening.</p><p>The doctors told us that if she hadn’t come in by sunrise the fever would have killed her.</p><p>A few weeks later the sides of my face expanded as hers had done, and I lay in agony, unable to talk or eat, being tended to by my mother. It was an ugly illness, not only in that it had none of the romance or drama of my friend’s, but also in that my face was distorted in such a way that I couldn’t help but cry any time I accidentally saw my reflection.</p><p>Neither the German doctors nor a string of English ones were able to diagnose what it was that we contracted, and neither the expensive drugs we bought at the night pharmacy in Berlin nor the antibiotics I acquired for free from the National Health Service cured it. It simply faded with time, and I have no assurance that it won’t one day come back. So it is now in my nature to touch my face habitually in a superstitious prayer, haunted by that strange sickness, not quite able to believe it was real.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Imagine how the old king takes his time coming down to meet the stone, how the rock must wait while he, without worry, may keep to a gentle descent, even pausing when appropriate to lookout below. Think of the view from the top: the whole world pressed into flatiron plains. There, below are the bluegrass fields where in early October boys run wind sprints past the line between the swing-gate and shed, where cleats catch mud in solemn ritual, and where young rushing bodies smash young rushing bodies and footballs are tucked underarm. There, even farther, is the hill that you and I used ascend every day in autumn, attempting to catch sight of eggs hatching in the chickadees’ nest; and there are the tracks, ridged over lopped stems from the mower that one day minced grass with eggshells. The ridgelines are still there, you’ll see; rain pours through them like slag.</p><p>To prove himself at hero, an Athenian champion once came to Corinth and successfully pushed a boulder up the Sicyonian hill. Only when the rock balanced in place, the Corinthians laughed. To them, the only thing the champion had proven was that the gods didn’t believe he was worthy of being pushed back. Keep an eye out for champions, kid. But most of all, pay attention to the way the break-winds unearth the shrub-root and the slugger Sisyphus, who is feeling quite good: the tall mound diminishes behind without surcease, the stadium lights warm on his shoulders — rushing 282 yards, and after today’s work it’s 317. Oh, hell, who gives a damn that he must lift the boulder again from the start? He carries like a champ, and gets to spend half his life walking down mountains.</p><p>So for chrissake, kid, listen: Nice grab today on that skinny post.</p><p> </p><p><i>Illustration by Kiara Barrow ’16</i></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Newman is the former publisher of the</em> Harvard Advocate.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"330\" src=\"http://snewmanblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_1095.jpg?w=248&amp;h=330&amp;crop=1\" width=\"248\"/></p><p><b>I. </b></p><p>Housing Works was standing room only on the night in July when Hungarian novelist László Krasznahorkai sat behind the microphone. I had just arrived back in New York from a five-week stay in Budapest, and I was surprised to see that the SoHo establishment had, at least on this night, become a more fervent mecca of Hungarian literature than Budapest’s own university bookstore. Americans crowded around the author whose reputation as an overseas phenomenon was just starting to gain traction in the United States. From the front of the room, Krasznahorkai discussed his winding syntax and signed copies of his newly translated novel, <i>Satantango. </i>Given that Hungarian books seldom attain an American readership (Hungarian is a grueling language to conquer), the stockpile of Krasznahorkai hardcovers represented a triumph for both the author and his reviewers.</p><p>Moderating the Housing Works discussion was James Wood, the critic largely responsible for introducing Krasznahorkai’s work to an American audience. In July 2011, Wood published a feature in <i>The New Yorker </i>exploring the Hungarian author’s unusual fiction. Casting Krasznahorkai into the literary constellation of avant-gardes Bolaño, Bernhard, Sebald, and Foster Wallace, Wood calls Krasznahorkai “perhaps the strangest” of them all. He identifies the novelist as a craftsman of the long sentence, a visionary who pulls his plots just to the brink of revelation—but never beyond. Krasznahorkai’s impulse toward cataclysm is his most distinctive feature. His three novels available in English—<i>War and War</i>, <i>The Melancholy of Resistance</i>, and <i>Satantango</i>—all describe worlds that brim with foreboding. Characters imagine paranormal manuscripts, a Hungarian village becomes home to a whale’s body, bells ring from no discoverable source. This sense of impending doom in Krasznahorkai’s work led Susan Sontag to call him “master of the apocalypse.”</p><p><span id=\"more-821\"></span></p><p>Master though he is, Krasznahorkai is not the only luminary on the contemporary Hungarian literature scene. Novelist Péter Nádas, whose <i>Book of Memories </i>also garnered Susan Sontag’s acclaim as “the greatest novel written in our time,” plays an equally vital role in nourishing Hungary’s literary life. Nádas is famous for his 1,000-plus-page novels that entwine multiple narratives into Proustian fabric. His most recent publication is a collection of short stories and essays called <i>Fire &amp; Knowledge</i>. The book is humbler than his novels but no less accomplished. Nádas uses frank observations and tight prose to create the same discomfort that Krasznahorkai invokes with his evasive plots and meandering sentences. Where Krasznahorkai is strange, Nádas is candid. Both authors revitalize a literary culture that is often condemned to international oblivion. Americans reading their works know that somewhere between Budapest’s Hapsburg-style grandeur and post-Communist decay, literature blossoms.</p><p>But beneath Hungary’s cultural topsoil, political tumult rumbles like unstable tectonic plates. This year alone, the autocratic Hungarian government slashed university funding, slurred the European Union (to which Hungary was accepted in 2004), and introduced measures rolling back freedom of press. Legal scholars have disparaged Hungary’s entire new constitution as “unconstitutional,” and after the government violated the independence of Hungary’s central bank, the European Commission put Hungary on trial. The ultra-conservative Fidesz Party, currently controlling Parliament with a two-thirds majority vote, is only the latest installment in a long line of repressive governments. Before Fidesz, Hungary suffered through forty years of Soviet-enforced Communism. Prior to that, the Hungarian Parliament housed the Arrow Cross Party, a German puppet government brutally installed toward the end of World War II. The danger of yet another unchecked government, Hungarian-bred or otherwise, imposes a political continuity that is painful to witness.</p><p>Contemporary Hungarian literature is by necessity a product of the country’s unique political story. It is strange to think that, while Krasznahorkai and Nádas have been praised in America for their formal accomplishments, these writers are rarely discussed as an access point to Hungarian politics. Krasznahorkai, born in 1954, and Nádas, born in 1942, both wrote under the mantle of Communist censorship. Repression leaves their literature with a particular taste, and resonances from Communism and the preceding war echo through their texts. Recognizing the historical tinge in their writing helps us to understand the political past that so vitally orients Hungary’s political present. Beyond aesthetic value, these authors offer precious insight into the history of one of the European Union’s most troubled constituents.</p><p style=\"text-align:right;\"><a href=\"http://stephanienewman.net/2013/03/28/contemporary-hungarian-literature-the-politics-of-repression/\" target=\"_blank\">Continue reading “Contemporary Hungarian Literature &amp; The Politics of Repression” here.</a></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

We go to war.</p><p><span id=\"more-781\"></span></p><p>“We are what we repeatedly do,” Aristotle famously said, following with: “Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” A person is excellent by consequence not of some single heroic Herculean moment, but rather her daily doings. By Aristotle’s declaration, passive repetition yields active virtue; monotony is ennobled.</p><p>Habit does not always deserve such reverence, however, for it quickly devolves into crutch, dependency, addiction. What once primed character begins to chip away at it, sanding down a person’s agency until nothing remains but her repetitive doing. Even benign habits take their toll. If habit forms the bedrock of personality, then post this anonymously; for if I am what I repeatedly do, then I am knuckle-cracking and e-mail-reading, and of neither am I proud. Today, repetitive behavior is encouraged by a technological habitat of speed and revision. Status updates and Twitter feeds keep us checking, fomenting our embrace of the redundant while creating the illusion of perpetual novelty.</p><p>From nighttime stories and the rocking motion of the crib to the familiar rhythm of classes and weekends, our lives are inscribed with habit. We relish in the comfort of anticipated return. Sometimes this comfort becomes immobilizing. In <em>Swann’s Way</em>, Proust remarks: “Most of our faculties lie dormant because they can rely upon Habit, which knows what there is to be done and has no need of their services.” Habits are the personal secretaries of every man; efficient and underpaid, they enable their bosses to lounge about with minimal exertion. While Aristotle’s Habit is a noble chariot that might carry man to excellence, Proust’s is a numbing see-saw that steadies him in a predictable range of motion.</p><p>Yet the steadying force of habits, while numbing, ought not be too reviled. Rid of our demons of repetition, we would be racked with indecision. Imagine the paralysis we would feel upon waking up, getting dressed, making breakfast, if everything required reasoned deliberation. It is in part for this that the philosopher William James opined that, for every man entrapped in his habits, “it is best he should not escape.” Of course James’ recommendation is also informed by his more damning regard of a habit’s permanence: “the man can by-and-by no more escape [from his habits] than his coat-sleeve can suddenly fall into a new set of folds.”</p><p>“Habit” came into use in the 13<sup>th</sup> century to refer to the attire whose regular wear signals one’s membership in a religious order—a use we still employ. Only a century later did it acquire the additional, now primary, meaning we think of today. The word comes from the Latin “habitus,” the past participle of “habere,” which means “to have, hold, possess.” Its etymology leaves ambiguous the beholder of agency: who is the possessor here? Do we have habits, or do habits have us?</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

		"body" : "<p>The weather in Scotland is far from feverish. Clouds bristle, bulging in flocks along the tops of barren peaks. Houses and lampposts are swept into grey shadows. People grow smaller as they walk along the streets. Limbs fold in on themselves to brace against the rain. I used to imagine the sullen inhabitants of grey brick houses being swallowed up by their stone floors and heavy wood doors. I remember how harsh accents would rip the wind in my ears.</p><p>I am eight years old and am standing on the edge of a beach in Eastern Scotland. Cliffs cut harshly into rough sea. The sky is low, oppressive. I am wearing lime green leggings and small white trainers. The trainers used to flash brightly when slammed down, but now they only flicker wanly. I am trying to revive them, slamming my heels roughly on the pebbled beach. The heels remain white. My brother is standing next to me, skinny, his buoyancy repressed by the cold wind. He clutches his oversized coat around his frame and stares glumly out over the water. We do not talk.  It smells of burned rubber, the clammy sharpness of salt. Noises, frisky and anxious, emanate from the car a few meters behind us, from my parents standing beside it. They have lost a map. My dad has lost a map—my mum is saying—although it is just as likely it was her.</p><p><span id=\"more-392\"></span></p><p>My parents conclude, locate the map, and are upon us. They rustle us up and we set out along the empty beach. Up ahead I see amorphous, white shapes clustered along the beach. I don’t ask what they are. I look out at the grey sea, and back again to the forms growing ever more distinct. At once my brother begins to run, his coat flapping behind him. I look up at my parents but neither of them say anything. My dad smiles gently at me. I turn back to the beach. My brother has become just another blue stain against a field of white.</p><p>As we walk, the shapes become nebulous forms. I see that the white is flesh, large globules of jellied flesh. Long tendrils stream like fingers from the forms. The tendrils are wrapped up in themselves, in rocks, pieces of driftwood, empty coca cola cans. Some have been gashed upon the rocks, and their bodies splay outwards like broken corn. There are hundreds: they coat the beach.</p><p>My brother stops at the edge of the expanse. He looks curiously at the bodies and begins to poke gently at one with the edge of his shoe. My parents and I stop too. My mum looks sharply over at my brother. “William, stop that!”</p><p>The pathetic white globules nauseate me, with their flopping arms and gargantuan heads. But their nakedness makes my own flesh burn with anger. I keep looking but feel the heat rise up in me and begin to flare. I turn abruptly away from the massacred bodies and stare out over the ocean instead. I watch as a small bird rises on the wind. Its feathers are grey, but its wings are like fragile porcelain. Suddenly, the bird dives towards the ocean and resurfaces with something clasped in its jaws. It is a glazed, grey fish, thrashing violently.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Not to his family or community at large, but to a few trusted friends. The friend I’m staying with is one of those people, and she translates for me, telling him I’m interested in sexuality, that I study it at school, that we can talk. We talk and drink along the cobblestoned main drag lining the bay, the two of them feeling good in their irreverence—drinking beer midday during Ramadan—hair tousled by the Aegean breeze. The promenade resembles the center of a European city, Milan maybe, but smaller, less organized, less shining-clean, with the feeling that something has fallen through the cracks.</p><p>I ask him, “What is it like here?” The friend I am visiting translates.</p><p>“It’s bad,” he says.</p><p><span id=\"more-525\"></span></p><p>The days in this city are still, too heavy, punctuated only by the calls from the minarets, sounds that twine through the air in braided harmonies, and the motion of the sea.</p><p>“Really I want to leave. Go somewhere I can live more openly, find a job. I feel like there’s no one for me here.”</p><p>“Where would you go?”</p><p>“Italy or Spain, maybe.”</p><p>“They would eat you up in Italy.”</p><p>He grins, pleased. “If I can find work.”</p><p>The thought hangs in the air around us. I feel my privilege prickly in the heat: my United States citizenship, my English fluency, my anticipated degree.</p><p>He orders three more beers, and I insist that I’ll pay.</p><p>“How did you first know?” he asks me.</p><p>I shrug, the heavy afternoon spinning. “I fell in love with my best friend.”</p><p>He nods. “It’s always the best friend,” he says.</p><p>I ask him how, if it’s not something people talk about here, he even knew what gay was. I tell him about someone I heard speak once who didn’t know there was such a thing as lesbian until she was a teenager and saw one on Oprah, and how then everything she felt made sense.</p><p>He tells me about a popular Turkish TV soap opera with a gay subplot, a guy in love with his boss who comes out about it in the last episode. It’s as unrequited as his own crush was on a middle school classmate, he tells me, and on the first boy he kissed, last week.</p><p>“It’s always the gay subplots,” I say.</p><p>We have another beer each and talk about people we used to be in love with, and pretty soon there are hugs and tears and we’re sitting there by the garbage-studded ocean eating bad quesadillas and weeping into the twist of minaret-sound, into the hoot of the ferry crossing the bay.  I’m leaving in a couple days, heading back to Istanbul, then flying to Massachusetts where I can marry whom I please. When he hugs me I tell him to take care of himself. He’s staying here.</p><p><i>By Reina Gattuso ’15</i></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Below, listen to Robbie Eginton reading his poem, “Fum,” which is published this edition of the magazine. I was also thrilled to talk to him after making this recording; an abridged transcript of the interview is published here. You can <a href=\"http://www.theharvardadvocate.com/content/subscribe-0\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe to The Harvard Advocate here</a>.</em></p><p><em>– Kevin Hong ’15</em></p><p><span id=\"more-1267\"></span></p><p>Kevin Hong: Your poem has such a distinctive voice. The way you read it is interesting, too, because it’s hard to pin down. Can you talk about what kind of tone this is — eerie, nostalgic?</p><p>Robbie Eginton: I’ve never really tried. The story is as it always is, and the giant is in some kind of space where he’s aware to some degree of Jack’s perfidy, and yet he is able to sit down with Jack. He has some kind of power. Beyond that, the giant doesn’t need to physically threaten Jack, he doesn’t need to yell … he’s just putting Jack through this communication. I don’t know if I can piece apart why he feels motivated to say the things he says. But he needs, to some degree, to have this connection with the person who he’s trying to kill, who’s going to kill him or who has killed him. There’s also a power that comes with being in this out-of-time space and being the only one with a voice.</p><p>KH: On one hand, the poem is a threat, yet it also becomes a kind of confessional, strangely intimate. The giant doesn’t portray himself in the best light; he admits the grotesqueness of his actions. It’s interesting what you say about needing to connect because the connection is at once a threat — I need to get to you, you better watch out — but also I’m trying to <i>get to you</i>.</p><p>RE: In a sense, the thing that I’m threatening you with is connection. I want you to be emotionally connected, not just profiting off me.</p><p>I think one thing that’s going on is there’s an emphasis on the giant’s profession and his method. For me, the poem is not so much about the morality of these actions; I’m not terribly interested in that. I’m more interested that he makes his living by taking apart other people’s bodies; these others with bodies and habits become unnamed. This is what I’m interested in: when do the motions and shapes of our bodies have meaning, and when do they not?</p><p>KH: Did something about the story prompt you to play with it?</p><p>RE: I was interested in the fringe areas of body, where the body isn’t well-defined. Like dismemberment, things like that … Then I thought, isn’t it odd that the giant says, “Fee, fie, foe, fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman,” but when has an Englishman come up to the land of the clouds before? How does the giant know what the English smell like? That’s one of the deviations of my version from the standard account; he makes a habit out of grinding Englishmen, changing bodies into bread, or meal, at least,  unnaming them and giving them another name. This is kind of like Ursula K. Le Guin talking about names. If you read the Earthsea books, they have this focus on the “true name.” The name is sort of the form. You can give something a new name and it’ll change that thing’s essence.</p><p>KH: I also love the part where the grinding of the bones turns into bread. There’s the process of obliteration, which is also a transcendent act. Bodies become like a Eucharist, no?</p><p>RE: I hadn’t thought of that. If this were a poetry board meeting, I’d be embarrassed. That’s interesting because I hadn’t thought about the giant’s act as being a <i>creative</i> act. I guess one of the flaws of the poem is that we don’t see where that bread goes. What happens to it? Is the giant the cloud-equivalent of a miller? Except he mills people, small people … <em>(laughs)</em></p><p>KH: There’s also church imagery; the poem takes on an even more religious color.</p><p>RE: It’s definitely playing with that. I just hadn’t made the connection between the bread coming out of the giant’s workshop and the church. With the church, I was thinking more about his ability to see things in terms of higher concepts; I don’t think he’s very good at it. He’s a little bit like the title character in Borges’s “Funes the Memorious.” It’s about this man who, through an accident, develops perfect memory. He has infinite storage and absolute recall. But he loses the ability to think in generalities. Not only can he not understand that multiple dogs are the same species, but he can’t understand that the dog sitting <i>now</i> was the dog shaking its fur one second ago. The giant is not <i>that</i>, but he has a similar trouble — he’s very caught up in his body and the connection that his body has with other bodies. That’s where I was bringing in the church.</p><p>KH: I’m always enraptured by poems that are retellings.</p><p>RE: They’re fun!</p><p>KH: Is that your main mode of writing poetry?</p><p>RE: No, but I don’t want to say if I have one. I’m a young poet. This poem is fairly complete, I feel, but for the most part I’m still trying to maintain a mode where I don’t talk too much about my poetry in general. I can talk about this poem, it’s published, fantastic, but in terms of poetry that I <i>do now</i> I don’t want to say. I don’t want to be thinking about being in interviews and trying to explain things … I don’t want to get in that loop. The point is to write the poems.</p><p>The one thing that I think about “Fum” and a lot of my poems is that circumstances when I was writing it are woven into them. A lot of “Fum” was written in a church, which is why there’s so much church in it. I don’t do a lot of retellings, but I might want to try it again. I enjoyed playing with “Fum.”</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Moving from oil paint and linseed oil, she combines natural plant oil, urine, gold, copper and graphite to generate formally engaging, conceptually stimulating work.</em></p><p><em>In its Fall 2013 issue, </em>The Harvard Advocate<em> published one of her Aromatherapy paintings – paintings that are ephemeral, amorphous in shape and exude elegant aroma. Harry Choi ’16 had a conversation with Adibi about her work, in the studio that was once occupied by Amy Sillman — one of her former teachers — but now smells of jasmine, sandalwood and lavender.</em></p><p><span id=\"more-1370\"></span></p><p>Harry Choi: I am curious if you find your works to be in conversation with contemporary dialogue on painting – the repeated declaration of the death of painting, its relevance in the face of the emergence of conceptual art, or to put it more simply, doubts on painting’s ability to “express” an idea. How do you situate yourself as a painter in the context of this theoretical perspective?</p><p>Elise Adibi: I feel very lucky to be making paintings now when it is such a fresh and expansive time for the medium. The “conceptual turn” and the post-modernist critique of the 80’s and 90’s cleared room and created new possibilities for painting, When I started my MFA at Columbia in 2005, I had studio visits with critics who were in disbelief that I was making grid paintings. Several people told me that the grid was a dead end. Many of them were painters who had emerged in the 90’s, and at that time, making grid paintings had a very different meaning. I am so grateful that I am painting in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century. I think that through the post-modern critique painting has been renewed.</p><p>HC: How did you get into painting? Did you always want to become a painter?</p><p>EA: Painting came to me through other interests; Actually, I didn’t like my first oil painting class when I was 11 or 12 at all. I wasn’t interested in trying to make a copy of something that already existed, or make something “look like” something else. In college I wanted to be a philosophy professor and then an architect. It was at Penn’s architecture school that one of my professors suggested that I might actually be an artist. I was very moved that this teacher recognized me as an artist, for sure, but I thought to myself:  “Being an artist sounds hard and painful! And so subjective. I would rather stick with architecture.” But by then, it was too late, and the seed had been planted. That’s how I got to painting – life led me to painting.</p><p>HC: What were your primary interests? Do you think that they still affect your work?</p><p>EA: I studied philosophy at Swarthmore as an undergraduate, in a really rigorous, cerebral environment. What I learned through philosophy was very appealing to me — the kind of connections that you have to make between disparate thinkers and texts, my favorites being Kant, Hegel and Nietzsche. During college I thought that I would become a philosophy professor. But after college I worked in public TV (actually here at WGBH) and then got into urban design working for a professor at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design. That’s how I ended up in architecture school, where I realized that I wanted to become an artist.</p><p>When I first started making work, I wanted to do both architecture and fine art. I was making installations in relation to specific sites, a lot of which had to do with light — camera obscuras, windows and such. But these works, in the end, seemed all about painting. Painting was perfect in terms of representing the process of making. It’s what’s most effective in expressing my interests that have been always in me.</p><p>I still do read philosophy these days and I do feel that it is an important field for me. It does not form a one-to-one relationship with my work, and I don’t want my work to exemplify philosophy, but it is definitely a part of the conceptualization process. My first solo show, for instance, was called “A Priori”, a Kantian term. Phenomenology has also been a lasting interest, especially the role of perception. I titled my project at Radcliffe “Painting as a Site of Resistance,” and I proposed to make “Slow paintings that engage in a process of temporality and embodiment, which inhibit easy translation into forms of reproduction and image dissemination, since they are made to be seen in person.” This proposal turned into my show here called “Metabolic Paintings.” One of the Aromatherapy Paintings from the show was featured in <em>The Harvard Advocate</em>.</p><p>HC: The painting that was published in <em>The Harvard Advocate</em> is interesting in the way that it touches upon viewers’ olfactory senses. What was the drive behind these paintings?</p><p>EA: When I moved to Los Angeles after living in New York City for eighteen years, it felt like I had a sensory re-awakening. Spring starts in LA in January and by mid-February, the entire city smells like jasmine. And the orange blossoms, eucalyptus, lavender…. For an east coaster it felt like I was on a different planet. I started noticing people’s fragrances — people in LA wore much fresher fragrances than people in NY. I got some essential plant oils to make my own fragrance. When I got the Pollock-Krasner Grant, I left LA to go to Pittsburgh where I could live more cheaply and use the grant to make paintings. I got there in May and spring was in bloom– I had this strange experience of having six months of spring. It was in Pittsburgh that I got this idea of adding the plant oil with oil paint and combining smell and color. It just happened. But as soon as I got the idea, I realized it was huge.</p><p>HC: So nature was a critical source of inspiration.</p><p>EA: I think the concept of nature affects me in a more existential sense than a literal sense. Of course, when people look at the checklist for my show and see the materials used in the paintings, they’re going to think that I am very much invested in nature — the use of rabbit skin glue, urine, plant oil and such. More so than the material, though, I put importance in the experience of seeing my works. That is the reason why I want people to look at them for a while and really engage with them. My paintings are always in a process of “becoming” and they are, in some sense, recreated with each viewing. I see them as “actants,” which, according to Bruno LaTour, is “something that acts or to which activity is granted by others. It implies no special motivation of human actors, nor of humans in general.” I am very interested in this human/non-human subjectivity in my paintings.</p><p>HC: Do you consider your grid paintings from a similar standpoint?</p><p>EA: I actually don’t think that grid paintings necessarily are “opposed” to the concept of nature, as they might seem. Rosalind Krauss once wrote, “In the spatial sense, the grid states the autonomy of the realm of art. Flattened, geometricized, ordered, it is antinatural, antimimetic, antireal,” but the grid has historically been presented in relation to nature. Mondrian’s abstract language started with trees and the ocean and Agnes Martin once named her geometric paintings with words such as beach, island, and desert flower, though both Mondrian and Martin renounced their connection to nature at a certain point. With the grid paintings I have a firmer sense of how the finished product is going to look like, but then again there is so much chance in grid-making as well. This apparent opposition is one that I don’t want to solve, something that I want to continue to explore. These seemingly disparate works also show how process is such an important factor in my works.</p><p>HC: Do you think that a similar force is at work with your oxidation paintings?</p><p>EA: With oxidation paintings the process is such an important factor. They are so vulnerable — slight alterations in light and moisture will change them in unexpected ways. With other paintings, things are done when your paint dries up. With these, the possibility of changes and the unexpected nature of the changes all constitute the process.</p><p>HC: While the “incompleteness” that stems from possibility of alteration constitutes the formal aspect of the oxidation paintings, thematically, they are an interesting subject to consider within a broader art historical narrative. Andy Warhol made paintings out of urine. Eva Hesse’s sculptures are associated in terms of “écriture feminine” – the inscription of the female body.</p><p>EA: Eva Hesse is actually a huge influence on me, although she explored materiality in this uniquely idiosyncratic, personal way. One could say that there is an obvious connection between us, given her use of grids and examination of materials.</p><p>I love that my work can provoke such questions on feminism and gender. Part of the reason why people raise such questions would be that my works are about the binary relationship between the grid and the body, which do not negate each other but coexist.</p><p>HC: I think co-existence is not only an important word to describe your oeuvre, but also with regards to your role as a research fellow at Radcliffe Institute. What do you think of Harvard as a place to create art? Can art making and institution coexist?</p><p>EA: It’s amazing to get such extensive support from Harvard; I feel so lucky to be here because of the quality of resources that I have access to. Other research fellows have been influential to my works as well. The writer, Lewis Hyde, for instance, showed me how to use gold leaf and I am now making 24k gold leaf paintings which will be shown in New York this fall.</p><p>The most basic thing, though, is being able to do a show that is not commercial. I had this idea of creating a wooden floor, and the Institute was doubtful at first, but people loved it and they’re keeping it for a while.</p><p>People are thinking about Kant and graphite with me here. I love it.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

They dab on one last layer of beige powdered mask. They look into the mirror and at once they see another face. It’s happened before—it happens every night and twice on Sundays—but it’s always a procedure. Costumes on, stage positions set, poses at the ready, the lights go out and the curtain is drawn back. It’s showtime.</p><p>From the heat of Fever we’ll move, this month, to the beam of the show. Our posts will broach the thrill of acting and the beat of performance. The heady pleasure of cosmetics in disguising a face—the tiers of fabric swathing a body—the lingering note of a final score—are heaved onto the stage for the taking. In our reach, theater is on an equal footing with theatricality. We’ll be publishing pieces that explore all sides of the dramatic, pieces that hammer drama into the contours of routine.</p><p><span id=\"more-428\"></span></p><p>We know the distinction between performer and audience: we create it, we insist upon it, even when it becomes obvious that the performer and audience need the other and that most everyone fits both roles. Showtime is the moment just after the suspension of disbelief and just before the audience starts to believe. It is also the artificial—the false. Showtime emanates nonchalance, but each gesture is assiduously manufactured and directed. Showtime is pretending. It performs nothing if not the art of deception. If what follows the announcement (<em>Showtime!</em>) is successful, the observer will forget reality, replaced with the new rules of a theatrical spell.</p><p>If all the world’s a stage, then who directs our own Showtimes? Or are we all our directors of theatrical scripts? The show plays with the fear of being uncovered. It threatens to tear off the actors’ masks while insisting all the while that their masks are their faces. The show is clever that way—it knows its own strength, knows that even when the curtain is drawn, the acting will go on.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

On the central loop itself is my dorm key. One loop removed is the key to home in San Francisco, a key to 21 South Street, my CVS ExtraCare card, and a miniature rice bowl keychain I bought last summer in China. If my fingers need to dig any further in my pocket, they eventually will hit a bottle opener and pair of compressible chopsticks. It’s always good to be prepared.</p><p>I realize that my pockets could be much lighter, but the bulk of the keys together makes the keys much harder to lose. I’d rather have too much in my pockets than not enough.</p><p><span id=\"more-906\"></span></p><p>I keep my wallet in left front pocket, and my phone and keys in front right pocket. As I approach the door, which leads to my entryway, I anticipate and reach into my left pocket for my wallet and turn it so my ID will face the scanner. After entering, I slip my wallet back into its place and immediately take my keys out of my other pocket, making sure they don’t get tangled with my phone. Without looking, I feel for the central loop, and separate my dorm key from the pack and have it turned ninety degrees to enter the keyhole horizontally. I slide it in, its teeth perfectly matching the lock, turn it, and lean in with my body to open the door. As I slip into my room, I tug the key out and by the time I sit down at my desk, my keys are already back in front right pocket.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"> *</p><p>During my last few days at home during spring break, I was walking up the stairs to the front door and my mom, a little behind, carried some groceries. I instinctively went to my pocket and pulled out my keychain, and my fingers felt around the center loop as my hand approached the lock. I pushed the key slightly and met resistance. It didn’t fit. I tried to push again, but had never needed to force it before. My mom looked at me, as I fumbled through my keychain, to the second loop, and found my San Francisco key. As if I had never opened the door before, I looked at key and methodically fit it into the lock. Everything felt different. At home, the key goes in vertically rather than horizontally. I had forgotten that with this old door it is easier to open when you pull the door closer to you as you turn the key. I eventually got it open, and my mom chuckled. I made a mental note to make sure this would not happen again while I was home. For me, it felt like an embarrassing waste of time, and a reminder that I wish I spent more time with family in San Francisco.</p><p>As I left for the airport, everyone else was walking down the stairs to the car in the driveway, and I was responsible for locking the top latch of the front door. I reached into my pocket and felt around for the top loop and raised the key to the lock. It wouldn’t fit. I quickly corrected myself, glad that my mom didn’t see me make the same mistake. We arrived at the airport, said our goodbyes, our I-love-yous and six later, I arrived back at Harvard Square. I made my way to Eliot House, and to my room, and when I reached for my keys as I approached the door, and I raised my hand towards the lock, the key slid in smoothly and my roommate was there to welcome me home.</p><p> </p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

In the story, Lieberman describes the symptoms and disease of a pervasive “whoever-cares-less-wins” paradigm, offering an analysis that includes anecdotal, statistical, and literature-based research. In this interview, Lieberman discusses her writing process, her Harvard experiences, and her own strategies for navigating diverse interests and opportunities as a young professional writer. </em></p><p><span id=\"more-1375\"></span></p><p><strong>Your article offered a different and refreshing angle that resonated with a lot of readers. I was particularly interested in the part where you disagreed with the notion that “hookup culture” is the problem with college dating, which seems to be the angle that many people take.</strong></p><p>I don’t think you can simply diagnose “the problem” by saying that people are hooking up. Up until Hannah Rosin wrote the article “Boys on the Side” in <em>The Atlantic</em> as an off-shoot of her book <em>The End of Men</em>, people weren’t really examining the millennial “hookup culture” phenomenon with a particular focus on how stereotypical ideas of gender dynamics came into play. It was when I read Hannah Rosin, and when I found myself disagreeing with undercurrents in her argument, that I felt propelled to make my argument <em>not</em> about hookup culture. I wanted to think a little more about the emotional terrain of what I was talking about.</p><p><strong>Often, when people write about college dating, it is very gender based; women are either victims, or too much in charge. How did you navigate writing about college dating, without getting too caught up in the misleading and obvious ways in which gender seems to be part of it?</strong></p><p>I certainly identify as an ardent feminist, and living in the Co-op at Harvard—not to give the Co-op all the credit—exposed me to a community of people that was thinking about gender and sexuality way more critically than anyone else I had ever spent time with. I’d say one thing that was extremely difficult was balancing my desire to take advantage of the opportunity to write for a wide audience—<em>Cosmo </em>readers—with my understanding that this wide audience may not want to hear everything that I wanted to say.</p><p>The Hannah Rosin piece and the <em>New York Times</em> feature, “She Can Play that Game, Too,” that came out this past July, both laid out arguments that basically equate sexual liberation for women with the ability to “act like men.” That really didn’t sit well with me. When I sat down and really tried to digest these arguments, it occurred to me that I really wanted to collapse our cultural assumption that emotional vulnerability = weakness. If we continue to perpetuate the assumption that “acting like a man”—in the stereotypical, backward sense—is equivalent to empowerment, we are not going to get anywhere. This assumption still privileges men over women. What we’re fundamentally privileging right now is a patriarchal value system in which being an asshole is empowering, which it’s not.</p><p><strong>I was also wondering about the fact that you talk about Harvard somewhat—you’re clear about where you’re coming from and what your experiences at Harvard were like, but what about this issue is particular to college or Harvard?</strong></p><p>It was a kind of balance, as you point out. <em>Cosmo</em> was interested in the story being about Harvard specifically, but also wanted it to appeal to a wider readership by pointing out arguably “universal” dynamics. And I guess I also don’t think Harvard is that different. That being said, I think the final club culture is a bizarre version of fraternity culture, and it’s bizarre because it has heightened dynamics around privilege and exclusivity attached to it. I should also note that I was actually going to talk about the Advocate in the article, but that seemed way too niche for <em>Cosmo</em>’s readership. Although I think most of the people I dated in college were on the Advocate, including my current boyfriend. I’m happy to admit that to the Advocate blog; I don’t think that’s a surprise to anyone.</p><p>To answer your question about college in particular: the thing that sets “college dating” apart is that it’s a microcosm, so everything feels—and is—far more ramped up. College students are living, learning, eating, drinking, and sleeping around each other at all times. So by extension, everyone has the opportunity to be attracted to each other at all times; this creates the opportunity for people to act blasé, or “care less,” as if they have a million things to do all the time—and often, they do. At Harvard, people construct their identities so that they seem very intense in all these different facets of life, and that lends itself to a kind of convenient way of distancing yourself from people. I also think that the intense intellectualism at Harvard is a defense mechanism for so many people, myself included, and I think at the Advocate especially I found that—like, are we on the same page about Proust? We’re flirting because we’re talking about Proust.</p><p><strong>I want to hear about your process of writing and research.</strong></p><p>I started from personal experience and as drafts progressed I kind of created concentric circles of outreach. I sent an email to my close friends, and then my close-ish friends, and people from Harvard, and then people I had met once, and people in my Gmail contacts and then I was sending Facebook messages and having my Facebook status be, “Please reach out if you have a story about someone you were dating using text messages to make you feel insecure.” I did feel a little uncomfortable putting myself out there, but it was productive in the end. I will say that the subject matter really made people feel generous.</p><p>Then, I wanted to find a way to ground my argument with statistical research, something I could build upon with anecdotal research. I interviewed Lisa Wade, who coined the “whoever-cares-less wins” dynamic. She’s a professor at Occidental college. She was really tapping into this idea that acting stoic has been valued because it’s inflected by patriarchal values. And then I referenced a book, <em>Guyland</em>, which I actually read in a class called “Masculinites” in the Harvard WGS department. So the research was personal experience, generalization, asking questions about that generalization, constructing an argument, and then going back to weave in statistical and literature-based research to tie my ideas down into something more concrete.</p><p><strong>Now that you’ve been out of college for a little while, have you noticed things changing in terms of the way these things work? Do people adopt different attitudes once they have started to embark on things outside of Harvard?</strong></p><p>One of the things I miss most about college is constantly being surrounded by people who could be really cool. I’m a freelancer, so I don’t go to an office and I think that makes it feel less omnipresent. That said, I think that almost every single person I know who is living in New York right now is on Tinder or OKCupid, and online dating totally shifts things. It’s complicated because on one hand, the “whoever-cares-less-wins” thing is less of a problem, because everyone is there to meet someone so they’re admitting that they care. On the other hand, everyone can meet a million people in one click of the mouse. So, if they’re on a date with you, and then they don’t get back to you—maybe they’re on another date. There’s so much room for ambiguity that I think it makes the anxiety worse, in a sense.</p><p><strong>I want to hear more about how your writing career is going, and how you’ve made the transition from being a writer at Harvard to entering this new scene. There are so many different expectations about what is it like to have a creative career, what is it like to freelance, and what do you do if you want to write.</strong></p><p>I was put in touch with <em>Cosmo</em> through a connection and got the article by successfully making it through “an audition” of sorts. In the midst of my search for a “normal” 9-5 job, a bunch of other freelance writing opportunities started to accrue. In December, I got an email through the Harvard NYC alumni list from a woman who started a juice cleanse company in Shanghai and they needed an English copywriter. I secretly or not-so-secretly want to do something related to health and wellness at some point in my life, so I talked to her over Skype, and the opportunity totally fell into my lap. Then, while I was on a meditation retreat with my sister over New Year’s, I got another gig with the meditation author Sharon Salzberg working as her editorial assistant. In this sense, “putting myself out there” has really made all the difference.  I think that the main thing I gleaned from these past couple months has been about knowing how to characterize what your interests and skills are. I didn’t expect to make a living from writing, but it’s totally working. I’m not working in a literary environment, but I have my own time for my literary pursuits; I’m still writing tons of poetry, and I’m having my poetry published in April in the <em>Boston Review</em>. If anything, the fact that I’m doing something else gives me space to breathe and pursue it in a personal way. Writing can manifest itself in ways you might not have expected.</p><p><strong>I wanted to come back to what you said about being a feminist, which often seems like a crazy, complicated, challenging idea to be and talk about these days.</strong></p><p>What I’m really interested in doing as a young feminist is being earnest about it. I’m sick of the fact that irony seems to have to accompany anything serious. There’s a way in which the HBO show <em>Girls</em> is really smart, but it’s also extremely sardonic. It’s doing all of this work, but with the many ways that irony is at play it’s hard to even keep track of what’s ironic and what’s not. I think that it’s really important to believe that your ideas are interesting and valid, and therefore be unapologetic, and emotionally vulnerable, about that.</p><p>College gives you a stable environment, but in the world it’s easy to feel like your ideas exist in a vacuum. I didn’t think my article was good before it came out. You always feel insecure about your own work, but now that I have responses I’m excited to feel that I have my own interesting point of view. In the nonfiction world these days there is such a trend of defending your authority on a certain subject, but I think it’s a matter of really owning it. I’m not going to apologize for being a feminist, or say that it’s uncomfortable. I think that an earnest attitude really disarms people, and there’s a risk—but the benefits are super powerful. I’m really interested in representing things about our generation and being honest and emotionally grounded as opposed to always bringing it back to irony and humor. So we’ll see, I’m meeting with this agent on Tuesday and we’re going to try and discuss potential book ideas, because I want to keep up the momentum.</p><p><strong>That’s exciting.</strong></p><p>Yeah, I don’t really have ideas yet, but I will by Tuesday.</p><p> </p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

The alphabetical kind. They lie on the surface of jagged, shrapnel-like scraps of paper and were once part of The Sound and the Fury. Perhaps the printing house of my edition disliked the book and chose an especially brittle paper for it, knowing it would disintegrate in my hands as I read it. Hundreds of pages fell out and splintered when they should have folded; it seemed like pre-programmed self-destruction happening out of sympathy for the Compson family. I no longer own a copy of The Sound and the Fury.</p><p>But I’ve been carrying around its remains all semester. I sometimes find pieces lodged between leaves in my notebook, or occasionally stuck to my toes while I study. They show up everywhere, clinging to objects I transfer from one bag to another, or leaping into my hair in the process. Every time I put a book, notebook, or object of any other kind into my bag, I further pummel the already tortured fragments that haven’t made a run for it. By the end of the semester, the pool may be indistinguishable from the sand that hitches a ride in my pockets after a weekend retreat.</p><p><span id=\"more-1287\"></span></p><p>“Hats not unbleached and not hats.

Again.” (95)</p><p>I suspect this isn’t the passage cushioning my notebooks, since none of the scraps I’ve picked out have had traces of underlining. But if not taking up the margin of my backpack, it’s one of the passages I carry in the margins of my thoughts. Not because it strikes me as particularly true; in fact, I find myself with no opinion of Harvard as a gestalt. But the characterization strikes me because I have encountered sadness here — in myself and in others — and a kind of clinging made permanent by rigor mortis onset from repeated deaths. Death is too strong a word. But the idea of death marks the point in this recursive cycle of hope, effort, achievement, and disappointment where amnesia sets in and the next iteration begins. It is the shock of realizing that the goal you reached had little to do with the desire that led you to set it. It is the achievement of a supposed end that shows you how far you are from what you want. It kills you by saying how wrong you were to think this is the answer and by never pointing out that the overarching question is the issue.</p><p>Clinging. To former selves, to simplified value systems, to long-lost social practices, to ideas of what this place should be, and to the idea that validation from one more group will lead to satisfaction. The absence of dissatisfaction when you see whatever it is that you want revives you so you can climb and cling even harder when the next death comes around. It’s a world built on anticipation; on knowing there are so many tomorrows that could give us what we want, and on ignoring that we thought the same of the yesterdays.</p><p>The orts of paper in my backpack are the predecessors to dust, and I cling to them. Dislocated from their source, they have accumulated on a surface I would have no reason to visit, except to clear them away. But they aren’t dust yet, because in my mind, they cling to the sorrows and longing and faults and naiveté that they once carried. They are still a part of The Sound and the Fury, and they still carry those tormented words about Harvard. Maybe I’ve made these morsels into a vehicle for my cynicism about motivations, keeping me aware of the sadness and disappointment that come when your only options are to hang in place or to let go. At least they have given me a view to hold onto.</p><p>I’ll throw out the scraps of paper eventually. But for now I’ll let them sleep in my backpack, which hangs in a building whose walls are old, dead brick.</p><p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>By Sarah Rosenthal ’15</em></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Image courtesy of <a href=\"http://expressaomanuscrita.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">expressaomanuscrita.blogspot.com</a></em></p><p>I’ve only been lost in the woods once. Which, I’ve been told, is more times than most people have been lost in the woods. At the time, I remembered something that seemed important. What I remembered was science class in grade school. In that class, I made a compass.</p><p>Even now, I remember how: Get a bowl. Put water in it. Set it somewhere flat. Take a piece of paper and put the paper on top of the bowl. Steal a sewing needle from your mother’s kit and a magnet from the refrigerator. Bring them to class. Stroke the needle over the magnet, each time in the same direction, and repeat this step for a minute.</p><p>After that, it’s simple. You place the needle on the paper and move a corner of the paper back and forth to get the needle to spin. Then, you wait. When the needle stops, follow its point to find your way.</p><p><span id=\"more-941\"></span></p><p>It was a lesson on magnetism — how Earth had it naturally — and how science allowed us to harness the phenomena that, before science, seemed like magic. Looking back, it was quite the message, though of course it was lost on the class.</p><p>The reason it was lost wasn’t that we weren’t perceptive; it was because mine didn’t work. Rather, my needle never stopped. It kept spinning, going faster and slower as I neared and retreated. The class was in awe.</p><p>A boy in the class told me about his uncle. About how I was like this uncle in that I too was a “water witch.”  Many know them as “dousers,” but in short they’re people who are believed to be able to find water using nothing but a twig and some inner connectivity with nature. How it works is they take a <i>Y</i>-shaped, light-weight branch from a tree, hold the two ends of the <i>Y</i> with both hands, and walk. When they are above water, no mater how far above, the branch will turn downward in their hands and point toward the water below.</p><p>The way that many discover their power is through magnets. Dousers have trouble finding reliable compasses, and though these compasses might not spin wildly in the hands of a water witch, they don’t point North. So, that day in class, it was settled: I was a water witch.</p><p>When I was lost in the woods, remembering this day in class was comforting. I had long given up on the hope of having some magical power, or anything at all that made me different from anyone else. No matter; the thought was reassuring: even if I had a compass, I still might be lost — and not just because I couldn’t remember whether the adjoining road ran east to west or north to south. And lost or not, I would never go thirsty, as long as I was willing to dig.</p><p>In the coming posts, I can assure you that you’ll read from those who have lost their way, and maybe found it again, and maybe did so using a compass. Maybe that compass is metaphorical. And maybe these pieces are in some way a metaphorical compass for you. Maybe you are lost and these stories will serve as your guide. Maybe you’re looking for this piece, right here, to be that guide. I want to assure you: it’s not. Rather, there are only two morals I have to share: First, if you want to impress a group of third-graders, construct a compass and leave the magnet in your jeans pocket. And second, if you need to find your way, use a compass. It will take you wherever you want to go … as long as where you’re going is north.</p><p>I hope you enjoy the theme. Or, dare I say, get lost in it.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

You weren’t a rock star, after all. No risk of getting fat and fading away.</p><p>Sometimes, especially if I granted you that second syllable, you’d persist. “What would I do with myself at that point, you know?” (You’d open up your laptop.) “It’d be so boring.” (Arrested Development would be playing, though you’d seen each episode at least three times.) “You know?”</p><p><span id=\"more-1066\"></span></p><p>But the real rockers — I wonder if that’s how they felt. If Elvis feared obscurity more than oblivion. If Jimi worried about wrinkles. If Johnny Cash ever murmured a death wish to June in those confused moments before sleep; if he ever proclaimed one defiantly into a mug of coffee: “I’d rather be dead than eighty.” If June would sigh in reply or look back at him with eyes sharp and glistening as moonshine, wondering whether she wasn’t enough, whether their love might be worth the arthritis and boredom. “Eat your breakfast,” she’d say, afraid that God had heard him.</p><p>You’d rather be dead than eighty, you told me — picturing, perhaps, the afternoons spent entering and exiting sleep alongside a murmuring television, the slow decomposition of the body. Picturing the day you’d need help in a public bathroom stall, your son-in-law lowering you to the seat and looking away with some mixture of politeness and pity, blocking the door to spare you the dignity. Your concern wasn’t Johnny’s, exactly. He thought people would stop paying attention. Were you afraid they’d have to start?</p><p>Or — or was it this. Johnny would lower his mug and look at June; he’d want to tell her everything but knew it’d sound stupid. He’d do it anyway: “What happens if I lose it all, June?” It was the kind of paralyzing, vague fear that might come upon him in line at the grocery store. “What if a big thing gets small?”</p><p>You’d lower your mug, too, and look at me, and you’d be a small thing, and it was that smallness, the smallness into forever you were afraid of, but you’d plaster over it with <i>so boring</i> and <i>you know</i>. What if a small thing never got bigger?</p><p>Then again, I was the only one you ever said it to — <i>I’d rather be dead than eighty — </i>and so I can’t shake the feeling that it was neither of those. That you were declaring something about yourself, picking a role, because you were afraid I’d become the June to your Johnny, the sun to your moon, and you wanted the roles reversed. To be dead and not eighty is to explode like a Kerouacian sun, to erupt with the sheer force of life and life lived. To be eighty and not dead is to watch stars explode around you, to have that slowly drain your light because you’d merely been reflecting them all along. It is to be inert, stony, alone.</p><p>(When June died, Johnny only waited four months to join her.)</p><p>But you had forgotten the thing about moonshine: that jarred, collected, it might be set ablaze. Put a lighter to it and it’d burn like a little sun.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Aside from being editor-in-chief of <i>Nat. Brut</i> since January of 2014, I’m also a freelance designer and cartoonist. I’m working on two books and several different comic strips concurrently. When I’m not doing all that stuff, I spend my time being a reclusive vegan and watching<i> Law and Order SVU</i> and lots of disturbing docs.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/devils.jpg\"><br>\r\n</a> <a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/kayla.jpg\"><img alt=\"Kayla\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1685\" height=\"517\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/kayla.jpg?w=670&h=517\" width=\"670\"></a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Kayla getting her hands dirty.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>TYLER:</strong><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\"> Howdy, I’m Tyler.

The majority of my duties are concentrated in the legal and financial ends of the magazine. I also serve on several of </span><i>Nat.

Brut?</strong></p><p><strong>KAYLA:</strong> <i>Nat. Brut</i> is a biannual art and literary magazine. We just moved into print, but we offer most of our content online, as well as a bunch of online-only multimedia content. We publish all sorts of stuff – art, short fiction, humor, poetry, comics, animation, short films. We also love found photos, and we’re obsessed with the public domain.</p><p><strong>TYLER: </strong>Oh! And we also oversee a handful of side projects. For instance, <a href=\"http://www.natbruttv.com/\">NBTV</a>, our television serial, utilizes archival video to experiment with the imaginative potentials of channel surfing. <a href=\"http://www.natbrut.com/n-a-t--b-o-o-k-s.html\">Nat. Books</a>, our online publishing house, releases obscure or out-of-print works in high-quality pdfs.</p><p><strong>KAYLA:</strong> Also, Sarah Hopkinson, our blog editor, is producing original content on our <a href=\"http://natbrut.tumblr.com/\">tumblr </a>multiple times a week. The blog is a gold mine and Sarah is a godsend to us. The blog is a daily dose of fun that is integral to who and what <i>Nat. Brut </i>is these days. It’s a site for our more outspoken and progressive detangling of ideas.</p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: Why the name?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>TYLER: </strong>It should come as no surprise that this question is the one we’re most frequently asked. Heck, it was the first question I asked Kayla when she first approached me about joining staff. As I like to see it, there are two different—though not totally unrelated—explanations for <i>Nat. Brut</i>’s name, one that is factual and largely banal and one that was retroactively fabricated and much more slick.</p><p>In the first origin story, <i>Nat. Brut</i>’s founders, when first toying with the idea of starting an online zine in 2012, suddenly happened upon a wondrous strange turn of phrase. Nat. Brut. They didn’t quote know what the words meant, but they knew they sounded cool. I agree that ‘Nat. Brut’ does sound cool. What’s more, the founders noticed that ‘Nat. Brut’ carries within it echoes of the phrase ‘art brut,’ a term first coined by the artist Jean Dubuffet to categorize a range of art works and art forms lying outside of the art world’s conventional purview. This resonance has become increasingly more appropriate as <i>Nat. Brut </i>has become ever more committed to publishing the work of demographics traditionally underrepresented by literary and art publications, although we ourselves would never call such work brut.</p><p>The second explanation is that ‘Nat. Brut’ is a piece of purposeful nonsense. It is an empty signifier just waiting to be imbued with meaning, a meaning that we create through what we associate with the magazine. That is, the total accumulation of artists, authors, pieces, films, comics, episodes, interventions, gags, swags, events, non-events, pressing issues, supplemental issues, and legal boilerplate. This explanation, for me, always calls to mind found objects, which only take on the status of ‘art object’ when placed in a particular context with a particular intention. One might say that <i>Nat. Brut’s </i>name is similarly a piece of found language, of <i>langue trouvée</i>, whose sense entails only in relation to the artistic, social, and environmental context that the magazine’s editors, contributors, and readers construct around it.</p><p>Yes, is that a hand I see in the back?</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/students.jpg\"><img alt=\"Students\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1687\" height=\"441\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/students.jpg?w=670&h=441\" width=\"670\"></a> <em>Students learning</em> Nat. Brut.</p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: How is Nat. Brut different from other arts and literary publications?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>TYLER: </strong>As soon as one opens up <i>Issue Five</i> and glances at the table of contents, one will notice the profusion of media that <i>Nat. Brut </i>publishes, a spectrum much wider than most other literary publications. We publish everything under the sun as well as some things above it. We believe that the juxtaposition of media and registers generates unique and often challenging insights. For example, placing a piece of flash fiction alongside a slapstick comic creates an emotional counterpoint that causes a reader to reevaluate both pieces in terms of each other. In a way, this surfeit of art forms and registers mimics the process by which most of us consume media, viz. through web browsing and news feeds. Of course, there are those who hold that such juxtaposition is distracting and violates a piece’s “artist integrity,” and this claim is not without its merits. If one feels that way, then they can either stick to reading our content online or go elsewhere, I guess.</p><p>As Kayla has mentioned, a not insignificant portion of what we publish comes from the public domain. This decision stems from an understanding that artistic underrepresentation is not a problem limited to the present. Aesthetic, racial, gender, sexual, geographic, and class biases in publishing have always existed, and because curation is at its essence a process of selective omission, they always will. Our Photobox and A/V Corner series are our humble attempts to right (and write) a few of the wrongs of the publishing past. That, and share with our readers what gems can be unearthed through the venerable act of obsessive web surfing.</p><p>Oh, it’s also worth noting that <i>Nat. Brut </i>has a distinctly silly side. Not silly in the sense of lacking judgment, but rather in the sense of being open to taking risks and making mistakes; of following whimsical intuitions to their logical or nonsensical ends; of laughing at ourselves from time to time. Many literary publications operate according to self-imposed senses of propriety that, when left unchecked, lead to ossified, stuffy, and admittedly, boring cultural institutions.</p><p><strong>KAYLA: </strong>Also, when I became editor, I didn’t just want<i> Nat. Brut </i>to be an art and literary magazine that operates outside of or above conversations about race, gender, and class. I want <i>Nat. Brut </i>to be a part of these conversations by working with artists and writers who are actively engaged in them. I feel like many magazines hold themselves accountable for upholding ideals that are solely artistic or literary. Often the goal is to present the best, or the newest, or the edgiest, or the most surprising, or the most under-appreciated, or the most intellectually rigorous work, and individual issues may tackle specific “themes” like feminism or poverty. None of these approaches are necessarily bad or wrong, but when a magazine is focused primarily on holding itself to an artistic responsibility, it’s easy to allow social responsibilities to fall by the wayside, and to become part of the problem. Frankly, I’m tired of seeing white men running magazines and publishing the same tired old straight, white, cis-het male demographic. I’m frustrated with the landscape, and my goal with <i>Nat. Brut</i> is to try to manifest the change I want to see in that landscape.</p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: How “Harvard” is Nat. Brut, if at all? How did Harvard influence Nat. Brut, if the influence is there?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>TYLER: </strong>When not secretly imagining <i>Nat. Brut </i>as an unconventional tech start-up, I like to imagine it as a growing, preternaturally articulate child. And children, as we all know, come from somewhere and carry that somewhere within them no matter the places they go or the things they do. Put less tritely, genes don’t lie. And were one to map <i>Nat. Brut’s</i> genome, one would find that many of its genes are crimson. As one can discover through hardly any mouse clicks, much of the magazine’s current staff are either Harvard students and Harvard alumni. This is due to the fact that when Kayla and Axel first took charge of the publication, they understandably reached out to people whom they knew about joining the magazine, and most of these people were their college friends. Although <i>Nat. Brut</i> might be run by Harvard grads, that does not mean that <i>Nat. Brut </i>is a “Harvard” publication. To be honest, interpreting the idea of ‘Harvard’ in certain negative, historically-conditioned lights, we strive to be the opposite of a “Harvard” publication.</p><p>That said, it’s worth acknowledging that Harvard has contributed the bedrock of our staff’s professional expertise, and for this training, we are very grateful. During their undergraduate tenure, many of our staff members were heavily involved in <i>The Harvard Lampoon</i> and<i> The Harvard Advocate</i>, where they acquired experience composing, designing, editing, and underwriting established, large-scale publications with readerships in the tens of thousands. When we’re feeling especially precocious, we like to place <i>Nat. Brut</i> in the long tradition of print publications with strong ties to Harvard, including <i>The National Lampoon</i> and <i>N+1</i>. When we’re not, it’s usually because we’re looking at our bank account.</p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: So you’re in Dallas. Is </strong><a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/ddelheas/30-ways-you-know-you-live-in-dallas-6aws\"><strong>this article</strong></a><strong> accurate?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>KAYLA: </strong>Haha, yes and no, I guess. Who writes these things, anyway? If you’re a red-blooded, sports-loving, beer-drinking, square-dancing, truck-driving, meat-eating, Texas-proud, straight white guy with an active nightlife who’s lived in Dallas for thirty years or so, you’ll probably take no issue with this list. Otherwise, it’s pretty annoyingly presumptuous. Not to say that I take any offense at all at Dallas being summed up in trite, gross ways. I’m not particularly attached to this city.</p><p><strong>TYLER: </strong>But if you’re willing to drive thirty minutes outside of Dallas, Denton can be a pretty fun place, especially Mabel’s Beauty Shop & Chainsaw Repair out on University Drive. That place rocks!</p><p><strong>KAYLA:</strong> Best place in all of DFW!</p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: What’s the good and the bad of Dallas?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>KAYLA: </strong>The good is that I can afford to live here and pursue freelance work. I can’t afford to live in any of the few cities I would want to move to and still do what I want to be doing creatively or professionally. The part of Dallas where I’m based now is relatively quiet, and there’s no overt community or culture, so there’s little here to distract me. This may seem lonely, but it allows me to remain focused and productive. Basically, it’s cheap and I’m not miserable. It’s also a great place to nurture <i>Nat. Brut</i>. I don’t want the magazine to have a regional identity, and I think that if I lived in a city I actually liked, then there would be a risk of wanting to connect the magazine to the community and place it within a local scene. <i>Nat. Brut</i> is ever-evolving, and I want it to belong to everyone, everywhere.</p><p>As far as the bad goes, there’s plenty to hate about Dallas, and Texas in general is a hotbed for repulsive patriarchal politics and social injustice in the way of gay rights, abortion, and racial violence. A lot of people question my choice to live in Texas. Some people seem disappointed by it and assume that I’m not able to live up to my (or <i>Nat. Brut</i>’s) full potential here, which is a bit insulting. There are certainly a lot of really unappealing things about Texas, but it’s important for me to stay grounded by remaining in the trenches, so to speak. By living in a place that is ripe with the sorts of social and political problems that I feel very strongly about, I’m able to remain intimately in touch with these issues and to figure out ways to respond productively to them. This tension also feeds into my creative practices, and fuels my work as both an artist and an editor.</p><p><strong>ADVO:</strong> <strong>Tell me about your latest issue. What are some challenges of migrating from online to print?</strong></p><p><strong>TYLER: </strong>Money. Just kidding not just kidding. During its first two years, <i>Nat. Brut</i> was blessed to live in sweet, halcyon days when the only operating cost was that of maintaining a domain name. Last fall, however, Kayla, Axel, and I collectively decided that we were interested in taking <i>Nat. Brut’</i>s free-spirited, socially-mindful aesthetic commitments and seeing how it would manifest itself in a physical object.</p><p>Approached from a theoretical perspective, a printed object is at its core ontologically different from a digital object. The former takes up physical space, has weight, is a different type of furniture. That is to say, it curates movement differently, the turn of a page directional in a way that a mouse click is not. All of these new discrepancies and variables were of extreme interest to us.</p><p>Approached from the seat of praxis, a printed object is radically more expensive to produce and requires an entirely different intra-organizational structure to underwrite it. Some magazines elect to create a business board responsible for selling advertisements. Others opt to hire a grant writer or two and go the non-profit route. Still a few more choose to hedge their bets and go for both. We lie in this third category.</p><p>Transitioning into print has also forced us to double down on our commitment to environmental sustainability. No one can deny that today’s world is a world of excess. Landfills brim with discarded printed material, and worldwide deforestation continues to catalyze climate change and lead us one step further into the planet’s sixth mass extinction. With these harrowing images in mind, we had to think long and hard about the ethics of creating an art object that would be irremediably tied to these processes of environmental decay. In the end, <i>Nat. Brut</i> decided that all of its issues would be printed on 100% post-consumer recycled paper. While some literary magazine choose to outsource their printing and materials in order to drastically reduce production costs, we have decided to eat the premium cost in order to ensure that we and our readers, while reading our issues in bed, can sleep at night.</p><p><strong>KAYLA: </strong>As for our latest issue, aside from it being our first in print, a large part of my vision was to accomplish a substantially visible gender parity and have a significant number of our contributors be people of color. I think it’s nonsense when other literary and art magazines aren’t diverse. There’s no excuse.</p><p><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/ssue-five-flip-through.gif\"><img alt=\"ssue Five flip-through\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1689\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/ssue-five-flip-through.gif?w=670\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">Issue Five <em>flip through.</em></p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: What goes into the making of </strong><strong><i>Nat. Brut</i></strong><strong>, in terms of content?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>KAYLA:</strong> We’ve decided to limit the submission window to one month per issue (it was previously two-three months). Some of the submissions we get can be pretty rough. I was really surprised by how many men submit (and submit again and again and again) and how many of their stories are awfully terrible to women. We now have a team of readers who expertly sort through it all, though. In <i>Issue Five</i> we got one or two gems out of over a hundred submissions. We really rely on solicitations. Each issue is planned months in advance. We’ve already planned most of the content for <i>Issue Six</i> and we don’t even open for submissions until May! There’s just no other way to do it. So much work goes into the planning that we can never start too early. Each issue has a few recurring features, like the interview, Photo Box, and Early Edition, which make issues a little easier to plan.</p><p>One of the most fun and low stress parts of putting together an issue is curating our online feature A/V Corner. Axel and I dig through the public domain and pair a short silent film and a few old timey songs together. We can kind of take our time with it and it’s really collaborative between the two of us.</p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: What goes into the making of </strong><strong><i>Nat. Brut</i></strong><strong>, in terms of production?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>KAYLA:</strong> The production process for an issue of<i> Nat. Brut</i> is two-fold – first we tackle the physical issue, then we tweak the online issue to fit the aesthetic and add in the content bit by bit<i>. Issue Five</i> was extra intense since we launched a brand new website that I had to build from scratch. All of the design work for the magazine is done by me at my computer. I spend a lot of time in front a screen.</p><p>To make a print version a reality we get in touch with our printer before the issue is even designed. We use an eco-friendly printer in Canada called The Prolific Group. We talk over specs, then I spend hours and hours working on all the design aspects that go into the issue. Axel writes all the copy and does most of the copyediting. All the little blurbs in the issue introducing features and stuff are written by Axel. He also writes most of the copy for our posters. He’s the words and I’m the pictures! After we send it away there are always mistakes. The online version is a lot easier to deal with since we can fix those mistakes instantly.</p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: What’s the launch event?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>KAYLA: </strong>Aside from being a celebration of the release of<i> Issue Five</i>, during which copies of the magazine and all of our other merch will be easily accessible, this event is an opportunity for us to bring the gender disparities that underscore the editorial vision of the magazine into the forefront of a public conversation among women. First, we’re screening Christina Kolozsvary’s short film from<i> Issue Five</i>, <i>The Astronaut and the Star</i>, which is a brilliantly surreal treatment of the threat of femininity – it’s like surreal 90s cinema by way of a badass feminist. Then, I’ll be moderating a panel of some of our foremost female contributors who will talk about their experiences with, thoughts about, and advice on navigating and subverting gender disparities in their respective creative fields. Panelists include writer Koa Beck, comedian Phoebe Robinson, artist and writer Robyn O’Neil, and humorist (and former Lampy prez) Alexis Wilkinson. This event is a chance for <i>Nat. Brut</i> to do something I think is even more important than trying to balance the scales within the pages of the magazine – actively engaging in open conversation and rigorous intersectional discussion about what it means to be a woman in this time and place.</p><p><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/panelists.png\"><img alt=\"Panelists\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1686\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/panelists.png?w=670&h=315\" width=\"670\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">Issue Five <em>Release Event Panelists.</em></p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: If someone wanted to contribute, what could they do?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>TYLER: </strong>As of now, there are four different ways one can contribute to <i>Nat. Brut</i>. First, you can of course submit to our printed issues. Submissions of all shapes, genres, and file formats are accepted during the months of May and October, and they can be directed to our <a href=\"https://natbrut.submittable.com/submit\">online submission manager</a>. Second, you can contribute to <a href=\"http://natbrut.tumblr.com\">our blog</a>, which publishes a mixture of news, reviews, short essays, as well as its much beloved column, <a href=\"http://natbrut.tumblr.com/post/114216469594/nat-brut-images-of-the-week-from-nat-brut-issue\">Nat. Brut Images of the Week</a>. Proposals for blog pieces may be directed to our inimitable blog editor, Sarah Hopkinson, at <a href=\"mailto:sarah@natbrut.com\">sarah@natbrut.com</a>. Luckily for the keen to contribute, <i>Nat. Brut </i>is a firm adherent to the age-old adage that collaboration is next to godliness. And so, if you have an idea for a project so wacky that only <i>Nat. Brut </i>could possibly pull it off, don’t be a stranger. Drop us a line at <a href=\"mailto:info@natbrut.com\">info@natbrut.com</a>. Finally, you can always support <i>Nat. Brut</i> the old-fashioned way by purchasing an issue (or better yet, a subscription!) and by telling your friends about us. Over the past year, during which we launched a successful Kickstarter to finance our transition into print, we have been amazed by how social media has grown our readership by leaps and bounds. Just as it takes a village to raise a child, so too does it take a village (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe_(internet)\">“tribe”</a> is the more official term) to raise a literary magazine.</p><p><strong><strong>ADVO: What’s in Nat. Brut’s future?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>TYLER: </strong>Well, in June we plan to participate in the <a href=\"http://newsouthfest.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">New South Festival of Literary Arts & Cartoonists</a>, hawking our wares, shaking hands, and spreading the good word of <i>Nat. Brut</i>. This <i>grand tour</i> in Austin will be followed by a series of summer projects. Our next issue is scheduled to hit coffee tables and select bookstores in late July. In August, we plan to launch what we are calling our “Artist Unresidency Program,” which will outfit one lucky writer with a bundle of bus tickets and gift cards to coffee shops across the country. We hope that this program will produce work heavily informed by North America’s built and natural landscapes as well as the lassitudes of chronic travel. Oh, and we’ve also begun our search to sponsor an endurance athlete, but as for our goals for that project, we’ll just let your imagination run wild.</p><p><strong>KAYLA: </strong>Aside from these fun side projects, we have big plans for <i>Issue Six</i>. Early Edition, our comics section, will be a gorgeous risograph printed booklet containing experimental comics work by female artists. I’m also planning something else fun as a supplement. Maybe a series of postcards interspersed throughout the issue. <i>Issue Six </i>will hopefully be mostly women, too, like <i>Issue Five</i>. I have the desire to eventually phase out work from cis-het white men within the pages of <i>Nat. Brut</i>. I know this is probably a controversial idea, but I don’t give a shit. With each issue of <i>Nat. Brut</i>, the more progressive we are, the stronger and more meaningful the work is. Representation among authorship matters. I also want to make it clear that we intentionally don’t market <i>NB</i> as a ladies mag or anything. I don’t want us to get pigeonholed and forgo male readership. I think, for us, it’s more effective to be an Art and Literary Magazine and not a Women’s Art and Literary Magazine so that more people stumble upon us. Men tend not to really read women writers. We want them to read <i>Nat. Brut</i> and, at least within the pages of the magazine, end up reading mostly women writers.</p><p class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\r\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\r\n\r\n</p>\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

The tile is khichri-slippery, and I have forgotten it is Ramadan. The Dargah of Sufi saint Nizaamuddin Auliya, a labrynthine complex open to the sky, shivers with a crowd: disciplined worshippers at a feast uneaten, as though laid out for ghosts. But they are vibrantly fleshy, minding babies and gesticulating as they wait for the siren signalling iftar to tumble down. I snake into a bulging queue with a combination of elbows and sweet talk, half propelled by the crowd and half propelling, until I am spat out, salty and sweating, at the tomb of Amir Khusrau.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span id=\"more-1462\"></span>Now there is Grindr, and before Grindr there was Yahoo, but before Yahoo—much before Yahoo—there was the bazaar. There are different myths in circulation about who imported homosexuality into India: some say the Britishers; others, through hard porn and soft imperialism, America. But for those whose proclivities tend toward the Hindu nationalist, there is always the option of blaming Islam. Of course, the evidence that homoeroticism was present on the subcontinent far before the medieval period is abundant—but in the paranoid, anachronistic tally of sexual sin, the Persian and Urdu poetic tradition in India, largely Islamicate, deserves a special shout out. And the tradition itself has a special place in its heart and loins for love between sweet-talking men and cruel, fuzzy-lipped boys.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Amir Khusrau, twelfth century Persian and Hindavi poet, was himself a great connoisseur of bazaar culture—or at least, his poetic speaker was. A sufi himself and a devotee of Nizamuddin, Khusrau is memorialized next to his teacher. That’s why he’s here, and that’s why I’m here, too, standing in front of his tomb on a smoky Thursday evening as parched dust eddies where the lazy breeze gestures, head bowed against the poet-saint’s tomb. It’s a slow night, acrid with kabob smoke and rain-longing, and I am feeling macerated with unrequited love. The pain of the beloved in Khusrau’s brand of poetry is less the cruelty of the forbidden than that of the unreciprocated, the heartsore: aloof queer girls with hair wound long like chains, eyelashes, lethally, Maybelline sharp.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><em>            Ah me, shackled to your every strand of hair. </em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>But in Khusrau’s poetic universe, sharp-eyelashed women aren’t the only ones cutting through the defenses of hapless lovers; there’s also the pain of barely-bearded boys. “The flourishing towns and markets created a culture of the streets based on interaction between men,” writes Saleem Kidwai in his and Ruth Vanita’s seminal <a href=\"http://books.google.co.in/books/about/Same_Sex_Love_in_India.html?id=rVlhw1u8dSwC\">anthology</a> on same-sex love in Indian literary and cultural history. “In these bazaars men from different classes, castes and communities mingled; here homoerotically inclined men met and established relations” (108). There are still cruising grounds in Delhi—humid parks lush green in the early evening—but cruising, I am told, is an affair increasingly separated by class. As in America, the sexual marketplace has moved online, and those who can take to the internet, do. The risk, however, remains stark. It’s common to hear stories of extortion or kidnapping, of police posing as potential partners then blackmailing instead. The <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/section-377-the-way-forward/article5740242.ece\">recent reinstatement</a> of Indian Penal Code 377 has only aided the threat.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Kidwai’s analysis of bazaar culture and how it surfaces in poetry has its critics, as does the entire reclamatory project of the same-sex, the homoerotic, the queer. How can one make a genealogy of definitionally unstable categories like gender—categories that don’t necessarily apply to the historical periods in question? Yet the rallying cry against “carnal intercourse against the order of nature” is that it’s un-Indian; the very weapon used against queers is twistedly historical. In this context, then, it is powerful to claim a line.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Evening topples onto the Dargah suddenly. At the siren the crowd glimmers, wakes and stirs; hands and mouths grow newly busy, and food disappears into burnt edges of roti and slick mango skins. Then everyone’s standing, shifting, fixing their kurtas, pushing for the exit, and I drift with the crowd away from Khusrau toward Nizamuddin’s tomb. When the call to prayer blows in like a fresh wind we are all buffeted by it; it sweeps the crowd. Then suddenly the Dargah is almost empty: a few swaying worshippers, a mucky open floor. The Qawwali singers, six or seven men in kurta pajama, are setting up shop.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Khusrau—notoriously virile— is considered the father of a lot of things: the tabla, the sitar, and the qawwali, the genre of devotional Sufi song. As in much Persian and Urdu poetry, in Khusrau’s work, religious devotion and secular sexiness get all mixed up. Yearning for the human lover becomes yearning for the divine, and vice versa; consummation, in both cases, is almost never reached. The longing for God is erotic, and it is a genderfuck.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;\"><em>I am enslaved by that face<br>\r\n\tno one’s allowed to see,<br>\r\n\tdriven mad by ringlets<br>\r\n\tno one’s allowed to touch…</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;\"><em>whether I look at him or not<br>\r\n\tI don’t have long to live.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>When the music starts, it rips through the air like a sudden rain, hot and loud. The vocals tear from the singers’ throat with fullness: the way relatives’ faces ballast with tears at weddings, or my mother’s expression when she says she misses me terribly and wants the summer to fly to my return. It is a benevolence bulging with longing, a turgid cell, a fish that has gorged itself to its own exploding, a body narcotic with love.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>When the musicians finish, I feel as though I have been stood up: standing all hopeful in pink lipstick waiting for a girlfriend, but nobody’s come.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>It was winter when I got my Khusrau copy, a dry and dusty season, headachey with studying and tiredness, sunlight weak and apartment cold. This was right after the court ruling came out about 377, and my friends were going to protests and talking angry and buying up multiple papers each morning to analyze <em>what they are saying about us</em>. Meanwhile, I was leaving Delhi in a haze of love.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><em>          Delhi and its fine lads<br>\r\n\t<em>          With their turbans and twisted beards<br>\r\n\t<em>          Openly drinking lovers’ blood<br>\r\n\t<em>          While secretly sipping wine.</em></em></em></em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><em>This is the real queer stuff</em>, my friends indicated, handing me a copy of Khusrau, a copy of Ghalib before I ran for the airport-bound cab.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>These cheeky, simple Indian lads have made<br>\r\n\t<em>Muslims into worshippers of the sun. </em></em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>I read the Khusrau as the plane ascended. In the front of the book, because this is the age of Grindr, the beautiful Delhi boys had written a couple stanzas of Shakira lyrics—that other great queer poet—and I laughed as we leapt into the air.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em> Trapped in the coils of their curly locks<br>\r\n\t<em> Khusrau is a dog on a leash. </em></em>\r\n</p>\r\n",

Not a promontory to be exact, but not an island either. When the tide is out, a fleshy mudland connects the Mount to the shore, and a delicate concrete thoroughfare rises, complete with besmirched scales. <span id=\"more-569\"></span>The Mount, more widely known as St Michael’s Mount, is a tidal island located four hundred yards from the coast of Cornwall. It is one of a pair, its sibling located on the opposite shore of France and known as Mont Saint-Michel. Mont Saint-Michel is majestic, stony, rising like an encrusted safe-house from the depths of the ocean. I prefer the Mount, although it is far less regal.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/hopkinson-3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"hopkinson 3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-572\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/hopkinson-3.jpg?w=670\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Unlike Mont Saint-Michel, it has no thick golden walls, nor layers of tumbling alleys, cobbled, darkened and haggling. Instead the Mount is rather meager; it is simply a small, unprepossessing harbor, resplendent in only the solemnity of grey Cornish stone. There are gardens of course, swathes of green rising in tiers from the quiet harborside, up to the thick walls of the slight castle that crouches at the head of the Mount. The Mount isn’t busy when I come, an overcast day in June, and fellow visitors are solemn, pregnant with the disillusionment of an English summer. The tide is in, so I take a small pink boat the four hundred yards to the Mount. The paint on the side of the boat is chipped, and its white undergarment glares luminescent amidst grey water. Moving swiftly into the empty harbor, with the sharp tang of fish fresh under my nails, I stare up at the castle’s veneer rising silently from the gloom.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/hopkinson-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"hopkinson 1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-570\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/hopkinson-1.jpg?w=670\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n",

Not to brag, but I was the male dance captain in my sixth grade community theater production of Guys and Dolls. I know a thing or two about the tango. Ten years later, though, fears of physically advertising an identity that makes me uncomfortable, whether too feminine or awkward or sexual or sweaty, keep me from busting a move whenever I am moved to do so. </span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Before this gets too deep into a weird analysis of the sources of my social anxieties, I’ll diffuse the tension like I usually do: by laughing at myself. </span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Duet (After Yvonne Rainer)</i> was an exploration of the visceral embarrassment that comes with putting my lanky, dancing body on display and, importantly, the humor to be found in that embarrassment. In the video, I try to emulate <i>Trio A</i>, a seminal work by dancer and choreographer Yvonne Rainer. </span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Trio A</i> strips away the reverence and distance often associated with Western notions of dance performances, and pushes the boundaries of perhaps the most primal, mysterious, and communicative of art forms. I thought this would mean I would be able to replicate it. Oh, was I wrong. Despite the magnificently pedestrian qualities of Rainer’s choreography and having it playing literally right in front of me, a lack of dance ability or maybe self-consciousness of my moving body precluded a successful replication. </span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">As a result, the video depicts a duet of sorts between the referent, tiny little Yvonne on my computer screen, and my own perversion of that referent. It’s hard for me to get away from my own experience of the footage (<i>Oh my god is that how my butt looks when I walk. It’s tiny but still so frumpy</i>) but hopefully it’s at least a little funny for the rest of you. </span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This little project of mine probably shouldn’t be taken too seriously—I’ll spare you the poststructuralist reading—but it is my hope that a viewer contemplates what exactly about my amateur rendition is making him or her laugh at (with?) me.</span></p><p class=\"p2\"><em>By Luke Fieweger ’16</em></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

It had other merits, of course, like an onstage pool of water and literary references, but when we stepped into the elevator with no one else around she looked down, shaking her head: “I just don’t know why he was naked.”</p><p>It was the aggressive sexuality of it all, the nude’s lack of subtlety, that made her so uncomfortable—but there was something else, maybe. He was so transparent up on the stage. There he was, all of him. His heart-shaped birthmark, usually tucked into his trousers like a piece of gum stuck between the leaves of a napkin, breathed free instead under hot lights. She felt, I think, like a voyeur.</p><p><span id=\"more-446\"></span></p><p>“Mom, push the button,” my sister nudged. We were still on the first floor. “Anyway,” my mother went on, “he could have worn a diaper or something. You weren’t naked in your debates, were you?”</p><p>I should probably clarify. I used to do Speech, which my mom calls Debate (my sister does Debate, which my mom calls Speech), and I never was, nor ever felt the need to be, nude. She meant merely to propose that my sixteen-year-old self, neatly wrapped in a black pantsuit, had subtlety—that first thing violated by the actor’s nudity. But did I? When, in high school, I competed in Dramatic Duet Acting, the scenes my partner and I chose were hardly understated: the climax of Edward Albee’s <i>Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf</i> (which opened, if I recall, with “George, get me a drink”), and two years later, the climax of Ryan Craig’s <i>The Glass Room</i>, the story of a Holocaust-denying historian and her Jewish lawyer. We were clothed, to be sure, but our words weren’t shy.</p><p>My scene partner—Frank, hi Frank, if you’re reading this we should get coffee Frank—was a brilliant actor. He was well-trained, but with a natural talent that would manifest itself as a sidelong glance or a particularly apt pronunciation of the word “love.” And I was new: to acting, to the Speech Team. I thought shouting lines made them more powerful and sighing deeply signified <i>intense regret</i>. I was, by all counts, totally unsubtle.</p><p>Synonymous with <i>unsubtle</i> is <i>transparent</i>, both hallmarks of Naked Guy, but the two don’t always travel together. Loud as I was, transparent I was not. And transparency is what I’m really getting at. What good actors do—what Frank did—is suspend me in their silences, keep me affixed to what seems so real in their emotions. When Frank spoke I could have sworn that that was what he felt, that I was seeing to the core of him. Then in a second, with a muttered, “Let’s take it from the top,” it all evaporated.</p><p>This transparency—and it was that, it felt like that!—was not of the fleshy variety that so discomfited my mother. No, this was the illusion of transparency. Frank was playing sad, and when the curtain fell his smile would return. But the actor in that show was not <i>playing</i> nude, he simply was; and so the delicate artifice of the play-world, where all emotions are genuine and poignant for the span of ninety minutes, collapsed.</p><p>This is what is unsettling about the naked body in theater. It is so distinctly non-performative. It speaks to our anxieties, we who carefully construct our artifices, each for a separate audience. (She laughs, throwing her head back, because she read in Cosmo once that men find that attractive.) Non-illusory transparency is terrifying because of its accompanying vulnerability, yes, but also because it cannot mold to its audience: when the actor is naked on stage he’s the same naked every day, though the cadence or the inflections of his monologue might change. We wear different selves based on mood and weather and surroundings, and to imagine that this power might be taken from us—well, what would they <i>think</i>?</p><p>I like the discomfort of the nude actor. It reminds me how few people I know as their naked selves. But it <i>is</i> discomfort, and this may have been part of what upset my mother. Then again, we were her daughters, and there was a naked man on stage. Why cloak the truth of the thing in verbiage?</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Advocate editors in 1934 were evidently more intrigued than deterred by accusations of “pornography” and “decadence” in Miller’s novel.

They occur frequently as the solution to differential equations in engineering applications, where they prove troublesome because they waste space throughout computation. They also occur on page 42 of the Winter 2011 <em>Blueprint</em> issue of <em>The Harvard Advocate</em>, though unrecognizable from this definition. From the page, vibrant neons erupt into symmetric, organic forms. Computer simulations are grafted onto the sterile negative, flattening time and space in turn and leaving the array of images meaningless, authorless, incorporeal, yet alive.<span id=\"more-1524\"></span></p><p>Like optical illusions of fleeting grey squares, the eye chases meaning throughout the grid of images, the entire submission a macrosystem, a matrix of matrices, whose opacity conceals the spectral ones and zeroes that endow indices with meaning or its absence. The title names the form and the content, and Schrödinger’s paradox leaves each simultaneously dead and alive, significant yet arbitrary.</p><p>Each image ostensibly corresponds to the system of some materialistic problem, confined by the artists to constant parameters—electrical charges, spring constants, general relativity—before relinquished and allowed to control its own appearance. The resulting matrices, abstracted into graphic drawings and assigned a color gradient, retain no residual indicators of the process of their creation, raising questions of authorship and artistic license. Corporeal relations become mathematical formalisms, algorithms, and the language of the machine. Each capitulates to the next, rendering the search for each form’s creator a recursive Odyssey, from nature to human to machine and back again.</p><p>It appears to begin and end with nature, the grid of images suggesting a taxonomy among natural processes that here represent themselves as recognizable life forms—flower, diatom, amoeba, bird, insect, and nervous system. Each the summation of human knowledge of the related problem, the matrix must then be a solution, or at least a blueprint, with some explanatory capacity. This indexicality is paradoxical; the bottom left image answers the question “How do you invest stocks and bonds so they produce the best return and least volatility?” The economist would be infuriated to know that the complete answer resembles not a bell curve or a paraboloid with a discernable optimization strategy, but a zinnia. The strength of connections is encoded within the color gradient, imbuing the symmetry of each image with similar irony—beauty and confusion share a source, and all understanding is lost.</p><p>The paradox of positing the graphic drawings as “solutions” destabilizes notions of explainability in emergent phenomena; we could not apply, transpose, or analyze this matrix, though it is the apotheosis of analysis. What, then, is the necessity of the symbols and languages, the function of the functions, created to explain and solve? Here the solutions are more enigmatic than the problems themselves, each of which is taxonomically distinct from the next.</p><p>Simultaneously an index of the equations humanity enslaves to describe the world and a confirmation of their futility, Hu and Davis’ <em>Sparse Matrices </em>facilitate an interrogation of both, even with a single glimpse of their organic ethereality.</p><p class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\r\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\r\n\r\n</p>\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Krithika Varagur ’15 introduces the theme; visit the blog to read more on marginalia in the coming weeks.</em></p><p>What compares to the shame of rereading? Returning a year, month, or week, to a book you rather liked the first time around, you feel a twinge of shame that the first pages’ metaphors are so <i>freshly</i> wonderful. You blush to realize<b> </b>that the comic subplot had entirely evaporated from your memory. Rereading the seminal (you thought) novel of that discontented summer, you seriously question where your atrophied memory places you within the populace; when every page seems so resolutely new, just what from this text had affected you so? Nabokov said that “one cannot read a book, one can only reread it,” but that’s cold comfort for the prospect that your remembrance of <i>Portrait of the Artist</i> may be as detailed as, and less accurate than, its Cliffnotes.</p><p><span id=\"more-1276\"></span></p><p style=\"text-align:left;\">Marginalia buttress this tenuous hold we have on our texts. They reassure us of our sentience as readers. Scribbling in page-frames, we become Le Philosophe lisant, meeting works with the courtliness and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/nopassio.htm\" target=\"_blank\">“scruples of welcome”</a> they deserve. Returning to Ode to Autumn in one dogeared volume, an old side note testifies that Keats picked up his “clammy” cells from Dryden’s rendition of Virgilian Pastorals. A cryptic index of page numbers over “Chapter One” lines up favorite sentences from The Charterhouse of Parma. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the sovereign and name-giver of marginalia, was an annotator in high demand. How wonderful to be able to make that request!</p><p>A margin once referred exclusively to a border around a sea or a lake; then around anything at all; then around text typeset on a page. Economists wonder what welfare is accrued at the margin, what extra return might tip over a system. How much better do we converse with each successive annotation? When does the return on marginalia end?</p><p>In 1637, Fermat squeezed in a mention of one “truly marvelous proof” into the white space around his copy of Arithmetica, thus precluding the proof itself.</p><p>Notations by, and not just on, luminaries can stir a voyeuristic fervor. Books can sometimes be about others’ books: the hope persists that one bracketed comment will pull back the curtain on some truly great, synthetic way of reading that informs the writing we love. Yet, David Foster Wallace, in the front-papers to his Rabbit, Run, asserts only that <a href=\"http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/press/releases/2010/dfw/books/\" target=\"_blank\">“Rabbit Mourns Himself.”</a> What are we to make of this, of anything? In the eighteenth century, annotation was an explicitly social pastime; groups of friends would circulate a single book until its margins were entirely blackened. Annotation in its current iteration is a whispered colloquy. One must distinguish, for now, between marginalia and scholia.</p><p>We wring our hands that marginalia will be coterminous with books made of paper, but our scribal impulse is too strong. The new, jostling mediums will do for the art of marginalia what photography did for painting; our notes can tesselate and refract, on electronic books and edges of screens, into Cubist meta-texts. Having thwarted its severest constraints – the size of the margin and penmanship – marginalia will have a radical new poetics.</p><p>On the edge, we scribble off the deep end.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Two lines of scrambled text scrawl beneath the image before terminating in a single, indecipherable word. The artwork is the result of two student artists – one having crafted text, the other the image it describes – and the piece thrums with division and recombination. The visual artist has taken a mild mid-twentieth century snapshot and fragmented the image, Xeroxing and re-Xeroxing rectangular portions onto a single plane, multiplying the mechanized reproductive mode of the photograph. The process of reproduction, akin to Warhol’s silk-screening, has preserved and introduced imperfections into the artwork. Some tessellated fragments are overexposed or contrastingly dark, others rough with large grains. The text repeats similar flaws in the inconsistency of ink and jumbled, offset type: the third line comprises the letters “g” and “e” and a final, crossed-out character. The relationship, however, between the text and the image is ambivalent. The process of creation and collaboration among artists is unclear and as a result parsing the dialectic between symbol and icon, reference and referent, falls to the viewer. Looking between text and image, the artwork begins to take on an erotic turn. The last word of “gex” links together a string of sexual phrases – “limbs”, “still warm from” and what could be “(k)issed” – and turns the viewer back to the content of the image. And yet on investigation <em>Untitled</em> presents not a passionate vision of two lovers on a motorbike, but a frustrated sensuality and a mechanistic neutering of the erotic. The legs of the young couple are reconfigured as gears of the automobile; natural locomotion and flesh propel only wheels. This reassignment becomes altogether menacing and the smiling faces of the motorcycle riders, many-headed and obscured by glasses and a scarf, appear less and less human. The image and its text point not only to the melding of man and machine, but moreover to the unsettling seams of such an alignment.</p><p><span id=\"more-915\"></span></p><div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_918\" style=\"width: 570px\"><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/hoch-pretty-maiden-1920.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"hoch-pretty-maiden-1920\" class=\"size-full wp-image-918\" src=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/hoch-pretty-maiden-1920.jpg?w=670\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pretty Maiden<em>, Hannah Hoch, 1920</em></p></div><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pretty Maiden<em>, Hannah Hoch, 1920</em></p><p>The co-artists touch on a common thematic fear, similarly noticeable in the art of Dadaists of the early-twentieth century. Hannah Hoch’s iconic photomontage <em>Pretty Maiden</em> of 1920 echoes a similar anxiety about the interdependence of the machine and the bodily while also pointing to a sterile sexuality. Like Hoch’s maiden, the fecundity of the young woman in this image becomes the productiveness of the assembly line, her output limited to spokes, bolts and rubber. A light bulb replaces the head of Hoch’s woman as she drowns in BMW logos, and here the tesserae effect of Xerox and use of text also point to the synthesis of man and machine. <em>Untitled</em> echoes Hoch and succeeds in illustrating that the more forced the marriage of the two, the greater the asexuality. In its production, the visual artist has violently spliced, cloned and reassembled the original photograph to present an image of the human body as it ceases to be human. The effect is startling and nearly sickening, just as Hoch’s light bulb-headed creation hints at something at once familiarly fleshy and violently mechanical.</p><p>But is this something to be feared? Or quite possibly wished? Complicating the artwork are the words of Warhol: “I want to be a machine” (<i>Art News</i>, 1963). Though it has been argued that this image and its text elicit unease in the violent reconfiguration of the body and the mechanized, <em>Untitled</em> may also share Warhol’s ambition. This evidences a healthy degree of ambiguity in the artwork that implies further and deeper readings, especially in the combined effort of artists and the ekphrastic relationship between word and image. This artistic duality is a striking and fundamental division that indicates only the first in a string of separations, stitched together in a complicated and successful portrait of the modern self.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

It’s also social commentary, a love story—anything other than just cheap thrills prodding masses to the theater. When Jennifer Kent’s The Babadook debuted in November 2014, critics called it a “Freudian study” and a “psychological thriller.”<span id=\"more-1748\"></span></p><p>The movie’s only flaw, many said, came in the climactic scene, which Kent jams with horror tropes. The bed rocks violently and rises (The Exorcist). The boy gets sucked up a staircase by an invisible force (Insidious . . . and, like, every horror movie).</p><p>But for me, horror is the genre most suited to the subject matter of the film, centered around a single mother and her young son. The afore-unmentioned father dies in a car accident driving his wife, Amelia (Essie Davis), to the hospital to give birth to their son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman). Seven years later, the boy and his mother rattle about in their grey-toned house trying to parse out what to remember and forget. Watching The Babadook, I was replaying the years after my own dad died.</p><p>It’s easy to dismiss that rattling house, that rocking bed, as tropes. It deflates the threat. But the tropes in The Babadook don’t serve to score cheap scares. They raise the stakes of the central horror, grief. It’s the best movie about grief I have ever seen precisely because it is a horror movie. As a fatherless child, sometimes your world is actually that terrifying. My mom feared for ten years that my grief would suck me into trouble (as it did) and depression (as it still sometimes does). She and Amelia were constantly haunted by the prospect of “losing” their sons.</p><p>My mom and I lived in a tall house out in the woods. Minus one person, the house became immense. Surrounded by dark trees that tapped on the windows at night, I appointed myself my mom’s protector-in-chief, but still checked under my bed every night.</p><p>After my dad died, lights seemed to constantly burn out and doors closed without reason. Surely that was because my mom wired the house herself and we lived in the windy Miami Valley in Ohio, but it all took on a sinister vibe.</p><p>Sam walks into his mother’s room in the beginning of the movie–he had the dream again. For me it was a flood rising in our house, trapping my dad in the basement as my mom and I swam to safety.</p><p>I knew my dad for eleven years. Sam never had that luxury. Both of us tried to recreate our fathers out of bits of memorabilia. Amelia<a name=\"0.1__GoBack\"></a> strips the house of every photo and memento of her husband and stuck them in categorized boxes in the basement. One day Sam ventures down, curious. He strews his father’s papers around the basement and performs magic tricks for his photos. When his mother catches him and tries to restore order to the memories, he rebels: “He’s my father! You don’t own him. You won’t let me have a dad.”</p><p>Sam disrupts Amelia’s chance of developing a friendship with a male coworker, trying to stop his mom from being intimate with someone who isn’t his father. Some reviewers have attributed Sam’s actions to Oedipal impulses. But the scene struck me only for the familiar desire to protect the supremacy of his dead father’s memory.</p><p>It took my mother six years to start dating. Last summer, she married a wonderful man whom I love, but for those early years after Dad’s death I looked with suspicion on any man who came near the house, mailmen included. I thought they were the first step toward all the photos of my dad vanishing into the basement. I outgrew this; my stepdad and other father figures helped honor my dad’s memory.</p><p>I had to remember him. “The more you deny me, the stronger I get,” the Babadook says. Amelia spends the first half of the movie denying the existence of the Babadook. But unlike most horror villains, it doesn’t wait for cover of night. It appears when Amelia drives her car, visits the police station, eats her morning cereal. Meanwhile her son invents elaborate medieval weapons in preparation for the impending violence. Like grief, the Babadook doesn’t wait for the time you’ve set aside for it.</p><p>Amelia struggles to face her grief in part because the people around her refuse to acknowledge it themselves. Her own sister asks her why she still acts like a zombie after seven years. The movie nailed the difficulty of connecting with non-grievers over loss. To support a griever takes bravery and empathy. I found those qualities at a group formed by students in my middle school who lost parents, but most others tried to talk to me about God and the afterlife, which apparently urgently needed my father (maybe God required a bass player).</p><p>I turn into a surly, moody storm cloud every October without fail. Trying to explain that to people feels like convincing them of a monster only I can see.</p><p>Two emotionless Children Services representatives “visit” Amelia’s home to investigate Sam’s absence from school, largely ignoring the obvious absence in the house. They have the power, like that invisible force, to take away her son. She isn’t like most slasher-flick victims, often vacationers exempt from the struggles and horrors of everyday life for the sake of making their death less emotionally taxing for us. The Babadook blends the horrors of the imagination with the horrors of the real world.</p><p>It’s often unclear in the Babadook whether terrifying occurrences are real or the product of hallucinations brought on by Amelia’s days of sleeplessness and years of hidden horror. In my dad’s last week alive my mom sat with him on the bed and held his hand. They listened to bagpipes that no one else in the room of relatives could hear. Beautiful hallucinations, but hallucinations neverthetheless. The grieving imagination can run wild. For my mom and I, it took years to grasp the reality of what happened to us.</p><p>For Amelia and Sam, it takes fighting a monster.  Possessed by the Babadook in a murderous rampage, Amelia chases her son to the basement, but he manages to incapacitate her. It’s the first time in the movie, and evidently their lives, when mom and son are in the basement–surrounded by memories– together. “You have to let it out,” he screams, and inspiring a Linda-Blair-style exorcism complete with an unhinged jaw and spews of black bile. The purge allows her to face the Babadook head on, but it puts up a fight. It makes her re-watch her husband’s bloody death, which she had been trying to push from her head.</p><p>This is why facing grief is so hard: talking about it often brings up unspeakable trauma. When I first tried to think about my dad’s death, I saw images of a skeletal man, wretched, soggy from chemo, bitter. I banished these. In the process I banished the man entirely. For the first four years after he died, I simply had no father in my memory.</p><p>But trying to erase the grief only creates a monster. As Sam reminds Amelia, you can’t get rid of the Babadook. Amelia forces the Babadook to retreat, but only as far as the basement where her husband’s memory lives. We cut forward about a year to Sam gathering worms for the seething but tamed monster. “It’s alright,” Amelia tells the Babadook. She soothes it, acknowledges it, lets it exist, and returns above ground to live. My bowl of worms is a journal Patrick O’Donnell left me to read after he died. I read it every year. I discuss it with my cousin, my mom, my friends—anyone who wants to share in his memory. I speak his name aloud lest the other monster return.</p><p class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\r\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\r\n\r\n</p>\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);</p>",

One dappled banana chopped over a sprinkling of strawberries, coated with a simple-syrup drizzle to brighten the dollop of tang marketed as Greek. It needs ice, and milk, and the employee adds them as I throw a fistful of singles at the register. Nine minutes.</p><p>Across the concourse, four friends wait for a boost of caffeine delivered in 100-calorie gulps. One latté, one cappuccino, one chai, one black coffee. Eight minutes, and the girl in the Pinkberry hat and Pinkberry apron and Pinkberry polo pours the pink slurry into a cup, just for me. 16 oz fills, and at the bottom of the blender there’s that little layer that always tastes best straight from the container, dripping down your jowls as stationary blades rest above your eyes. They should make a special drink, the “extra little bit at the bottom you always wanted but the barista always throws away.” I would buy that.</p><p>Their caffeinated vessels slide out as liquefied strawberry seeds skate between my teeth. Colton, our flax-haired keeper of the tickets, says he always ends up running to catch the bus. One last slurp, and my empty cup enters the trash. Faye sprinkles a delicate pattern of cinnamon on her tall drip.</p><p>I wouldn’t call it a run, more of a series of hyperextended strides from Starbucks to the terminal. The last open seats on the bus separate us into little Harvard islands, and I acclimate to this fate with some Kanye. Colton, however, swaps and barters us into an Advocate enclave hidden in the last two rows. We’re the cool kids in the back, legs up, chatting across the aisle, with prime access to the bathroom.

Megabus has a moist odor of desire, misery, and expectation. And Wendy’s. It has an odor of Wendy’s, as well.</p><p>I’ve come separately from the rest of them, so I emerge reeling creaky-legged from Mega and cart myself down into the rushandclatter of the subway, following their crumb trail of text messages to the Village, carting myself down and downtown. And here, eventually, they are: Sitting around a table in a dumpling shop, cheeks red from the transition off the street. We do names, because I don’t know them as well as they know each other, and meanwhile Sam is sucking the inside out of a dumpling: his lips to the plump dough, working his tongue into its crevices, sauce dripping down his chin. And my happiness is the happiness of seeing a flash of a friend’s red coat in the subway, a heady espresso-shot of recognition, a familiar clatterandwarmth. So we ask questions, silly at first but growing more and more serious: Would you stay with an otherwise perfect partner if they always referred to themselves in the third person? If they always videotaped you in bed? What if they were more successful than you were? What if you never authored another thing again?</p><p>We walk down the street afterward, linking arms, boots clacking, and because I am the group’s one senior the questions nag at me, get in my belly. The future looms, but in a productive way, maybe: It’s easy to feel like you can weave something when you’ve got so many skilled hands.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9853-as-smart-object-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"_MG_9853 as Smart Object-1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1512\" height=\"446\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9853-as-smart-object-1.jpg?w=670&amp;h=446\" width=\"670\"/></a><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9913-as-smart-object-1.jpg\"><br/>\n</a>Maia</b></p><p><b>Reina’s Rules:</b></p><ul>\n<li><b><b>Use the phrase “ineffable longing”</b></b></li>\n</ul><li><b><b>Use the phrase “ineffable longing”</b></b></li><ul>\n<li><b>Write about It’s Great to Live in Harrison Day.</b></li>\n</ul><li><b>Write about It’s Great to Live in Harrison Day.</b></li><p>We arrive at the MetroNorth terminal in Grand Central, Track 16, newsstand adjacent, archway opened like the mouth of a seven-year-old expressing ineffable longing for a Fig Newton.</p><p>Departing: MetroNorth, New Haven Line, off-peak, where sleek Armani dress-pants grow wrinkles and skinny girls eat Yoplait messily away from judgmental eyes.

Why so fucking cold?—we’re expedited via parental membership to Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs.</p><p>Within minutes, we’ve separated—not by our preferences for certain works but by pace. Later, my friend will draw a comparison between slow consumption of paintings and food, how both signal the refinement of deep examination. Speed, it seems, is superficial and barbaric, and indeed I’ve always prided myself on slow, contemplative pacing.</p><p>Yet that taste for the slow is far from a personal merit; it’s been bred by a privileged childhood of museum visits and cultural outings. Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu surfaces in my mind, reminding me that aesthetic taste maintains social hierarchy by falsely equating preference with aptitude. Those fortunate enough to be raised with the “correct” preferences maintain a position at the cultural center. It’s hard to teach yourself to slow down. Any self-satisfaction fades away when I realize the cut-outs have merely filtered us by class and geography; pace becomes but a marker for upbringing.</p><p>A child lunges toward a study of Matisse’s Vence Chapel, and I’m brought back to my own infantile rebellions against high-art.

They dance together, then separately, then once more as a pair—dividing and fusing over and over. My decorum cracks when the SPF surfaces for the third time. “Oh no, not again,” I grumble loudly, and—so I’m told—a knowing smile curls on the SPF’s mouth as my voice wafts over from three rows away. I’ve spoken what she knows and what the cultured audience cannot speak.</p><p>Fifteen years later, I too am conditioned to love the illusion of pacing, to relish and further Bordieu’s ghastly hierarchy of aesthetic distinction—just by moving slowly.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9913-as-smart-object-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"_MG_9913 as Smart Object-1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1510\" height=\"1004\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9913-as-smart-object-1.jpg?w=670&amp;h=1004\" width=\"670\"/></a>Faye</b></p><p><b>The Code of Colton: </b><b>Give each panelist a bizarre or funny or snarky epithet. When referencing them, try to use the epithet as much as possible.</b></p><p>The guard in front of the Guild Theater tells us to toss our coffee (“No food or drink allowed”) bought from Starbucks five harried minutes ago. I try to gulp. No luck, the liquid burns. I toss my fourth cup today, much more than I normally consume. Apparently New York demands coffee. Stopping for caffeine is a prerequisite to activity, no matter how late you are.</p><p>Once inside the dark auditorium, we hurry to our seats and are immediately treated to an onstage panorama of <i>New Yorker</i> folk: “seasoned” and “celebrated” travel writers (program title: “Hit the Road”). Paul Theroux, in tan jacket and round eyeglasses, looks like Rudyard Kipling and acts like he stepped straight from the savannah, misplacing his rifle and glass of bourbon on the way. Next to him sits Elif Batuman in a belted print dress, whose writing has been called “Helplessly Epigrammatical”. Effusive Gary Shteyngart fiddles in his seat, eyes jittering around in search of the Next Big Joke (NBJ). Dinaw Mengestu, a true Modest Mouse, waits for the program to start. Phil Gourevitch, trying to make himself anonymous, is the Moderator.</p><p>Kipling starts the conversation, claiming he writes his books in three months flat while riding Patagonian trains. Epigrammatic looks terrified at the thought. The NBJ flings something witty on the floor, some bit about checking into a Russian brothel for the elderly. Modest Mouse arches an eyebrow, but Kipling takes the bait and unintentionally asks the NBJ for the address of this fine establishment. The NBJ is gleeful; he grins a cock-a-doodle grin and knows he’s won this round.</p><p>Buzzing in my head intensifies—maybe it’s good I didn’t have that fourth cuppa, or maybe it’s a placebo effect. Moderator intervenes. This panel is becoming too heated, he senses. Moderator tosses a question to Modest Mouse, hoping for a lifesaver. Modest Mouse makes an elegant statement about social responsibility in travel, but the coiffed and collared audience isn’t here for that; they want fictitious blood.</p><p>The NBJ and Kipling scent the audience’s desire and enter an unexpected partnership. They deliver: verbally sparring, the NBJ’s ruffian Jewish-Russian <i>isms </i>take jabs at Kipling’s juicy patrician utterances. Epigrammatic and Modest Mouse, sandwiched between these two typic jousters under hot studio lights, begin to sweat. They sip from water bottles, talk of Russia and Ethiopia and university (they’re not far removed, and quite aware of the fact). Moderator bounces between everyone, trying very hard to remain anonymous.</p><p>All at once the program ends. The NBJ and Kipling lunge at their chains, raring for planes and duty-free cocktails. Epigrammatic and Modest Mouse had a fine time, but are ready to get the heck out of here. The audience steps up to ask questions at the mic. Our group exits the Guild Theater, passing Epigrammatic, who decamps via black car. On the sidewalk, someone mentions coffee (!), but it’s already past three o’ clock and the literary showdown has made us hungry. We decide on sushi. Alaska roll, anyone?</p><p><b><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9978-as-smart-object-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"_MG_9978 as Smart Object-1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1509\" height=\"446\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mg_9978-as-smart-object-1.jpg?w=670&amp;h=446\" width=\"670\"/></a>Emma</b></p><p><b>Faye’s Fiats: </b><b> Incorporate as many words you would use to describe sushi (a la Jiro Dreams of Sushi) as you can, even when the words are seemingly not appropriate.

I am charged with the solemn task of locating a sushi restaurant within walking distance of the Director’s Guild of America Theater Complex, and require help from Yelp – that beacon of eaterdom whose logo, I like to think, gestures toward fusion cuisine in its hybridization of Yahoo and Ask Jeeves.</p><p>The app has spoken! Cool as cucumbers, we roll out. Manhattan, this afternoon, is bright as a swath of ginger. We do not zigzag so much as chess knight el our way to the restaurant, heeding, of course, roe-esque red lights. The restaurant is a staid, spacious joint in the lower 40s. I believe we are its sole patrons (it is 4pm: meal barrens) but cannot know for sure because each table is hidden behind a papery, opaque barrier. The six of us (Jeannie, the welcome new addition) turn our attention to the menu. There’s some talk of dissent (Maia, I think, considers a rice bowl) but eventually, happily, all board the a la carte bandwagon.</p><p>Six famished undergrads, six plates of sushi. The rigmarole of dividing rolls occupies us for a minute. Chopstick-calisthenics background our conversation, which quickly veers toward technology: as ubiquitous as white on rice and, frequently, wasabi-like in its overwhelming intensity. Someone postulates that the ease with which technology enables us to duck out of awkward social situations (I’ll just stare at my phone now, thanks) discourages us from overcoming said awkwardness. Someone counters: but technology bolsters our ability to maintain casual friendships; a poke or a post is an efficient way to communicate regard, however remotely.</p><p>The sushi is delicious. Not as sticky as the Lam Caf veggie rolls I’m used to. And we are a cheery party – six edamame beans in a doubly-long pod.

The tickets say when the bus will leave, and my watch (when did you get a watch stop spending my money) says we will be late. Taxis (more $$$) ignore our waving arms until one does not and takes us to Grand Central (you mean the Port Authority), where we run on loud floors until stopping at a line, beginning the 45-minute wait for our 45-minute late bus.</p><p>New York entered my childhood as grandma’s and grandpa’s and mom’s (me) home. They lived “just outside the city,” in a town where their Reform Judaism stuck out like an Orthodox Jew anywhere else.</p><p>New Jersey, always a plane ride away.</p><p>The happiest memory of my entire life (large claim) is from New York (cliché claim). I’m three, or four, a week removed from running out of <i>Hercules</i>, terrified by the pre-millennium CGI imagined Hydra. I walk back in, my dad likes to tell people at Christmas parties (I don’t embarrass you), after an epiphany re: (stop trying to be DFW) conquering your fears of Disney villains.</p><p>The city stretched in every direction of the hotel’s concierge lounge. I can see it over the grey arm of my chair. It looks different upside down, sideways, like the snow globe I’ll buy (I’ll buy) later and shake shake before losing, somewhere.</p><p>Grandpa, the diamond dealer with the toupee, walks over to give me a carton of blueberries. All my earlier memories, of two and three and one, replay mentally with the bland sepia tone of forgotten, unappreciated Instagram pics. These blueberries, I can still see them now, and they’re blue.</p><p>New York would bring me back for grandpa a few more times, then his funeral, grandma’s 80th in the limo, some afternoons chewing ice cream, a college tour, all threaded together by a landing in Newark, followed by a connecting ride to the city along the George Washington Bridge. Vacation in Jersey, spend a day in Manhattan, then return home to palm trees on street corners under the Hollywood sign (a sweet paragraph; however, also unnecessary. delete).</p><p>This is my first time exiting the city on a bus, driving into a state that does not begin with New, without mom to guide me as I push the conversation toward words like “coffee” or “water” (stop it) to hear that thick accent reveal itself. With friends, the lull in conversation drags my eyes to the cobbled walls boxing in the highway and the buildings shrinking into houses until they become nothing for a moment.</p><p>And then the trees begin, and Harvard creeps back into our conversations. MOMA reflections twist into ideas on the Advocate, and throbbing bellies of credit card (!) purchased food throb at the thought of tomorrow’s HUDS. It’s tough to appreciate the weekend when our minds and bodies are both moving back to the place we have to focus on tomorrow; the 36-hour reprieve might just be another gcal (?) blip in between seminars and meetings. Or maybe I’ll remember sitting and talking and listening too, someday, in bright, distinct, blue memories.</p><p>I take a few pictures, and always end up in the reflection on the glass. It’s nighttime, and I can still see New York in all of our smiles (sappy ending; rewrite).</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Blog editor Kevin Hong ’15 describes our vision for this theme below.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:left;\">“The boat that lands there with a cargo of ginger and cotton will set sail again, its hold filled with pistachio nuts and poppy seeds …. ”</p><p style=\"text-align:right;\">Italo Calvino, <em>Invisible Cities</em></p><p style=\"text-align:left;\"><span id=\"more-512\"></span> Reading <i>Invisible Cities</i>, you reach Euphemia, a trade city in which you exchange not only sacks of grain and barrels of pig’s feet, but also stories. Upon departure, you find that your memories will have been transformed by the words that you have bartered: “Your sister will have become a another wolf, your sister a different sister, your battle other battles….” In Euphemia’s busy harbor, memory is traded as well.</p><p>There are other trade cities: in Eutropia, which comprises a number of cities, its inhabitants move from place to place whenever they feel, collectively, weary of their jobs, their lovers, their houses and debts. In the next city they fill new jobs, have new hobbies, and enjoy new friends; each city is a harbor for lives that shuttle back and forth, repeating the same scenes, but with different players. Ersilia’s citizens sustain the city by weaving intricate webs of relationships in their homes; when these webs “become so numerous that you can no longer pass through them, the inhabitants leave: the houses are dismantled; only the strings and their supports remain.”</p><p>Each city that Calvino describes is a harbor—by nature temporary, elusive, and ever-changing. ‘Harbor’ is related to the French <i>auberge</i>, meaning ‘inn.’ Protected by piers, a harbor is a dispassionate guardian, indiscriminately taking in bridge players, flus, magicians, and thieves for as long as they have business in port. A poem, with its own jetties and moorings, is a harbor of sorts. So are a lover, a lung, four years of college.</p><p>The same harbor appears differently to different people. A seasick voyager sees his home; a sailor finds respite from a storm; the traitor carefully moors his thoughts. We take refuge in its embrace, just as a harbor finds a resting place in the mind. There is always a harbor, but where it is and when it will cease is always uncertain.</p><p>Look at the dock on which you stand now; it is passing from prosperity to ruin. “The piers are pummelled by the waves,” Auden wrote: as Aeneas escaped Troy, as Ersilia’s citizens desert their homes, so we move from harbor to harbor. One after another, they sink below the ocean’s surface. What comes next? What haven lies in the offing? The harbor welcomes all of this: the orchids, jealousy, the crates of avocados, and the hulking ships that come to anchor, sails furled, but slightly unsettled.</p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

And the Wade-Thompson Drill Hall, as its name suggests, served as a training ground for American soldiers. When I went to see Ann Hamilton’s <i><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/07/arts/design/ann-hamilton-at-the-park-avenue-armory.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">Event of a Thread</a></i>, however, the space was devoid of its disciplined phantoms. Occupied by swings, pigeons, Ralph Waldo Emerson, white fabric, caped poets, caped readers, and caped bird-releasers, the drill-hall became at once amusement park and monastery.</p><p>Upon entering the space, I came across two seated persons, their fur-draped backs facing me. They were reading into microphones from manuscripts (of selected lines from Emerson’s essays) that draped off the table, folding upon themselves in wordy ribbons. I imitated a neighbor and held to my ear, like a conch-shell, one of the brown paper bags sitting on the table, to find that it contained a radio transmitting the voice of one of the caped readers.</p><p><span id=\"more-475\"></span></p><p>Past the readers and ribboning words began the swings, suspended from the ceiling by chains on both sides of a white curtain. Ropes attached to both the chains and the curtain ran through a pulley system, making the white swath swing. The curtain was twice as wide as the hall, so it, like Emerson’s prose, gathered and folded upon itself—its ribbons not grounded but suspended and restless, responsive to the comings and goings of the swings on either side. As Hamilton elegantly puts it, “the shifting weather of the white cloth is generated through collective action.”</p><p>While the weather of the lofty silk was socially generated, that of the swing was individually so. The path of each swing, illuminated on the floor by a strip of light, was private, to be tread by no one but the current sitters (I say this in warning, having been rear-ended by a particularly vigorous swinger). My paper bag spoke: <i>cause and effect are two sides of one fact.</i> Here, private moments culminated in a shared woven commotion. Private motion caused public stir; the two co-existed in un-contentious reciprocity.</p><p>On the end of the hall opposite the readers sat the monk-like poet, who toiled away at his verse, apart from the commotion. We were witnesses to his solipsistic moment. The poet’s privacy inspired others to seek the same; several visitors retreated into the shadows by the walls. One stared into the pages of Joyce’s <i>Dubliners</i>. Some climbed to the balcony, apparently heeding their paper bags: <i>the field cannot be seen from within the field</i>, says Emerson.</p><p>While wholly unique, “Event of a Thread” reminded me of two similarly space-transformative installations— one that created a domestic space; the other, a social space. In the show last year at Bard College’s <a href=\"http://www.bard.edu/ccs/exhibitions/\" target=\"_blank\">Hessel Museum</a> entitled “<a href=\"http://www.bard.edu/ccs/exhibitions/if-you-lived-here-youd-be-home-by-now/\" target=\"_blank\">If you lived here, you’d be home by now</a>,” Josiah McElheny displayed his own artworks along with works from the private collection of Marieluise Hessel in galleries furnished as a living room, bedroom, library, and dining room. McElheny’s co-curator, Lynne Cooke, describes their project in a book she edited in conjunction with the show, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.bard.edu/ccs/read/publications/interiors/\" target=\"_blank\">Interiors</a></span>. She explains that they sought to invite visitors to engage with the work personally, comfortably, at their leisure; to linger and incorporate the surrounding art as a backdrop to “conversations, musings, and distracted mental driftings.” Their ambition was to provoke a private, internal experience.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, the German artist <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/08/06/120806fa_fact_collins\" target=\"_blank\">Tino Sehgal</a> specializes in performance-based, participatory installations that engage the spectator. An exhibit at the <a href=\"http://www.mariangoodman.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Marian Goodman Gallery</a> in 2007 called “<a href=\"http://www.mariangoodman.com/exhibitions/2007-11-30_tino-sehgal/\" target=\"_blank\">This Situation</a>” featured several performers having a philosophical discussion. My family and I, visitors to the show, were encouraged, implicitly and sometimes directly, to join in. The significance of this piece was its social, rather than private, implications for the visitor; it traded solipsism for community (and perhaps some shyness and discomfort.)</p><p>McElheny, Sehgal, and Hamilton all share an aspiration to free art from the purview of the ascetic, numb-footed museum-goer. McElheny invites viewers to adopt his installation as the backdrop to an internal narrative; Sehgal, on the other hand, forces his viewer into a social space. In “Event of a Thread,” Hamilton encouraged the visitor both to retreat within and to engage without. While the transformed drill hall resemblesd no domestic space, the installation, like McElheny’s curation, invited an interiorized experience. The reader of Joyce and swinging couple can attest to this. And while the installation’s readers and poet remained occupied at their own tables, unresponsive to the rare visitor’s attempt to engage them, they, like Sehgal’s philosophizing performers, socialized the space. The very mechanics of the pulley-drawn curtain made physically manifest this private-public interplay. Hamilton puts it best: “If on a swing, we are alone, we are together in a field. This condition of the social is the event of a thread. Our crossings with its motions, sounds, and textures is its weaving; is a social act.”</p><p>In addition to the private-public exchange, the object of the swing contributed to another binary whose fine line “Event of a Thread” elegantly treaded: serious and playful. In transforming a seat into a vehicle of fun, and then inviting her visitors to enjoy it, Hamilton played seriously with notions of art-viewing. Diana Fuss and Joel Sanders, in “<a href=\"http://www.bard.edu/ccs/read/publications/interiors/\" target=\"_blank\">An Aesthetic Headache: Notes from the Museum Bench</a>,” describe the museum bench as a symbol of man’s unavoidable embodiment, that which enables him to surrender rather than attend to the artwork before him. In “Event of a Thread,” Hamilton attached the bench to chains and mobilized it into action. She embraced her visitor’s embodiment and desire to surrender, but the playful seat she provided compelled him, instead, to move and engage with her art.</p><p>Hamilton maintained her installation’s artistic integrity while allowing her visitors to seriously play within it. Fuss and Sanders describe in the same essay the public’s initial fear that a bench, when located within the museum (newly developing as a private institution), would encourage the behavior that it did in a public park: “flirting, playing…talking, laughing, and napping.” And if the park bench elicits this association, much more so does the park swing. Part of the magic of “Event of a Thread” was its capacity to permit such associations (the swings saw a fair share of all of the above-mentioned behaviors) while remaining artful and meditative. Hamilton succeeded in creating a world in which we could be both serious and playful, both alone and in good company.</p><p><em>Picture courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2012/12/07/arts/design/20121207-HAMILTON-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Philip Greenberg for The New York Times</a></em></p><div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n<div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"u\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n</div>",

Jeff. We met at Café Gato Rojo to discuss psychedelia, Harvardiana, and miscellanea. The following is a transcription of the parts of our conversation I deemed blog-appropriate. You can hear L.A. Jeff live this Saturday, October 19, 9 pm, at 21 South Street.</em> – <em>Kevin Hong ’15</em></p><p><span id=\"more-1208\"></span></p><p>Kevin Hong: Where are you guys from?</p><p>Nico Schwalbe: I was actually born in L.A., but I grew up in France. Parker is from here, Will is from NorCal, Sam is from England and Saman is from New York, but his family is from Iran. So we’re really from all over the place, which is somewhat unusual since bands so often form in these local microcosms.</p><p>KH: What was your previous band name?</p><p>NS: Lunar Volk, which is the name of our EP now. It was all recorded and engineered at the SOCH studio. Dan Thorn, who graduated in ’11, engineered and mixed everything except “To Good to Be True,” which was mixed by Strange Majik in NYC. I really want to give Dan and his band, The Dying Falls, a shout out for all the support they’re giving us!</p><p>KH: You played a bossa nova cover at your last show; I’m curious about how bossa nova fits into your style.</p><p>NS: Well that’s interesting. I’ve always had a connection to Brazil and Brazilian music because my family lived there for four years. My mom and my aunt, who passed away last year, were always listening to it. For me it’s always been there. In a lot of ways the format is jammy and there have been bands like Os Mutantes …</p><p>KH: The Mutants?</p><p>NS: Yeah! They were kind of one of the first psychedelic bossa nova bands in the sixties. They added the fuzz pedal to bossa nova, so there’s definitely a bridge between psych and bossa nova. Psychedelic music is supposed to “transcend” national boundaries: there’s Indian psych, psych folk, psych blues … It goes on and on.</p><p>KH: How about psychedelicious?</p><p>NS: Psychedelicious! I guess it’s psychedelicious because it’s supposed to stimulate your imagination in a pleasurable way.</p><p>KH: For the brain buds?</p><p>NS: Yeah, tasty for your brain buds.</p><p><em>(Laughter)</em></p><p>KH: Would you say Os Mutantes are one of your main influences?</p><p>NS: No, I wouldn’t say that because Saman and I are the ones who are really into that kind of music. Ultimately we all converge on sixties garage rock, which is such a huge mine of music. There were so many tiny bands back then: one guy would get a guitar for Christmas and the other guy a drum set and start a band, write these two minute songs. In terms of more recent psychedelia, I’ve been personally very influenced by the Brian Jonestown Massacre, which is essentially the vision of this one guy, Anton Newcombe, who’s been at it for  a very long time. I guess he kind of embodies the myth of the mad artist … for better or for worse. I also really like Sonic Youth. Sam really loves them, too.</p><p>KH: How would you guys characterize your band? I’m interested in the idea of a psychedelic band like yours being influenced by pretty crazy people, but also by more academic interests.</p><p>NS: I think most of us have a very nerdy, almost encyclopedic approach to music, which is reflective of the academic environment that we’re in. For myself, I’ve spent a lot time doing a lot philosophy stuff so it’s interesting to me to see the connections between theory and practice.</p><p>KH: You’ve also mentioned that you have this dream of pressing vinyl. You stream music, so why vinyl, which seems outdated?</p><p>NS: Yeah. In the world of rock music vinyl is pretty prevalent for releases because it has a more “expansive sound,” whatever that means. I didn’t really use to be into it until I kind of had a revelation where I was like: ”Wow, this really sounds better!” I think it’s a personal preference though. I guess today the real fans get the vinyl, just because it does offer a more complete listening experience; mp3 is so compressed, so you lose a certain sense of space. I don’t really think anyone makes any money selling vinyl though. <em>(Laughter)</em></p><p>KH: You mentioned that the garage punk bands of the sixties wrote very short songs, while yours seem to be longer.</p><p>NS: It’s true; our songs do tend to be more in the four-minute range. I like short, I like long, each one has its virtues. People also played short in the sixties because that’s how much music you could get on one of those cheap seven-inch 45rpm discs!</p><p>KH: I guess they had a different conception of the portable in those days …</p><p>NS: Totally. What’s really cool is a lot of music from that era, like Jamaican rocksteady and Ska, which Saman and I love, was mastered for small crappy radio speakers, so now it sounds great on your phone! Today, though, music is much bassier, which doesn’t sound great on the phone. So, in a sense, it’s less portable!</p><p>KH: That’s really interesting …</p><p>NS: I also think it’s fascinating that it’s really in the sixties that music started to become a mass consumption good, which it still is today, although a large part of that consumption is demonetized and basically free. When you’re paying Spotify, Rdio or Pandora you’re not paying the artist; you’re essentially paying for your access to unlimited free music.</p><p class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1215\" style=\"width: 680px\" rel=\"width: 680px\"><a href=\"http://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/l-a-jeff-photo.jpg\"><img alt=\"L.A.

Jeff performing at the Harvard Monday Gallery<br></p><p><br></p><p>KH: Where do you see L.A. Jeff in two or five years?</p><p>NS: Touring, hopefully, making more records, playing disco and funk (one of my personal dreams), and making people dance at our shows!</p><p>KH: <em>(Laughter)</em> Does no one dance at your shows these days?</p><p>NS: Not that much. A little bit?</p><p>KH: Is that a Harvard thing?</p><p>NS: It seems to be more of a US thing. I know that in France, where I’m from, people dance more willingly. A lot of US bands like Crocodiles or the Black Angels say that, too: audiences in Europe dance more, which is why we wanna go there!</p><p>KH: L.A. Jeff’s Euro trip! Do US listeners have more inhibitions?</p><p>NS: US listeners have a more critical outlook, both in the positive and negative sense of that word. They have greater exposure to rock music and it means something different to them than to European audiences. Because there’s less of a history of people being in bands there, people are more into the myth and the mystique of rock music, which is something I’m really fascinated by because rock is a myth in the dual sense of the word: it’s completely fake but it still has important symbolic capital.</p><p>KH: Greil Marcus delves a lot into this idea of the generational myth-making in rock.</p><p>NS: It’s weird, though, because for me rock isn’t really a generational thing. I really started listening to contemporary rock about a year ago. I guess I share more references with older people! I was always way more into The Stones than Radiohead, for example. I’ve been listening to them since I was three, and have been hooked ever since!</p><p>KH: You identify more with the sixties than with contemporary culture?</p><p>NS: Yeah, I guess … That’s part of the of the L.A. Jeff character. He’s stuck in the sixties.</p><p>KH: <em>(Laughter)</em> L.A. Jeff is a character?</p><p>NS: Yeah, totally. He’s a spirit friend that we carry along with us and he’s definitely stuck in the sixties delusion; there’s part of the sixties and of psychedelic culture which is definitely delusional.</p><p>KH: Is the revival of psychedelic rock intentionally delusional?</p><p>NS: Part of it definitely is. There’s this assertion that fantasy triumphs over reality, which is obviously delusional to an extent.</p><p>KH: I’m reminded of Nietzsche’s comment in “On the Use and Abuse of History for Life”; he talks about a culture’s need for an imaginary horizon. So does L.A. Jeff come from this need for imagination?</p><p>NS: Yeah, well, L.A. Jeff was born out of our imaginations one Friday afternoon over margaritas. We were trying to find a new band name, and someone had a tongue slip, and we were awestruck by the spirit that visited us. It just seemed to make sense and got our imaginations stimulated. We realized after the fact that L.A. Jeff may or may not be related to The Big Lebowski, another man stuck in the sixties.</p>",

It goes for an hour. Then take Exit 1 to I-81 and watch for the junction; you’ll want to head south.</p><p>You’ll notice I-81 is different from I-66. It’s I-15 more, and that means more mountains and less radio. You’ll have better luck with the AM stations, anyway. Spotlights in a barley field bear up at an old billboard that recommends AM 1020.1. “Sounds Right! 1020.1.” It’s an old ad so you’ll only hear static when you try, but tune two up and you’ll get Roy Acuff and His Crazy Tennesseans. You’ll remember that your father used to be a pretty good Roy Acuff until he found out there was already a Roy Acuff and had to start singing like himself instead. The radio mutters backbeats like a brittle tambourine; it’ll urge you to drive faster. You’ll <i>humm</i> along. For a second, you’ll doze.</p><p><span id=\"more-964\"></span></p><p>Veer left. Veer left! Take I-81 through Harrisonburg, Virginia.</p><p>You have friends in Harrisonburg so you’ll want stop off there — not to see them, though. They once introduced you to a Quaker steak and sandwich shop that sells day-old bread for ten cents to feed the ducks. You won’t feed the ducks personally, but you’ll enjoy supporting a business that supports feeding ducks. You’ll get an avocado and sprout club on a hoagie roll. You’ll imagine the ducks enjoying such a roll tomorrow. You’ll hope someone unlike you gives them the opportunity. You’ll miss your friends. Appalachians should be in sight. You won’t be hungry again.</p><p>Get off at Parkersburg (Route 42) and from there it’s a straight shot through the Shenandoah Valley. You’ll shoot straight through until you get to Buffalo Gap. Buffalo Gap is a two-block town, mostly dead, and as soon as you pass over the creek that runs perpendicular to it, you’ll lose cell phone reception for the next hundred miles. It’s that kind of town: right on the crust of civilization. You’ll think to stop there because there’s a homemade frozen custard shop in the gas station that sells Swiss Army knives to winos and old-time outlaws. You’ll recall coming here with your father as a boy. Back then you’d get vanilla custard because it was your favorite. He’d get vanilla because he hated orange, and there were only two flavors. You won’t stop there.</p><p>Begrudgingly, Route 42 turns into Route 39. You’ll miss the straight shooting of 42, but you’ll feel OK once you hit the broad turns of the Allegheny on 39. You’ll exceed the speed limit there, both because it’s easy and because there’s no one to catch you. You’ll only slow down once you realize just how easily your car could slip down the right-side ravine, where evergreen oaks finger the mile-long creases in the mountainsides, clawing toward you and the ridgeline like big cone pine spears, ready to impale. It’s recommended 25 miles per hour on the curves. You’ll speed up again later when you forget this.</p><p>You’ll pass through towns with similar-sounding names: White Sulfur Springs, White Springs, Warm Springs, Warm Bank Springs, Green Bank Springs, and then Minnehaha Springs. That’s the one you’re looking for, Minnehaha Springs. You’ll ask about that name — Minnehaha. It means laughing blue water. You’ll laugh when you find out.</p><p>You’ll pass the town’s schoolhouse, the town’s bait shop, the town’s church, and then the town’s second church. The townspeople will say there are only three things here: God, fishermen, and runaways. The third’s more rare, they’ll say, but sometimes at the junction of the great Indian rivers, ghosts still appear out of the wilderness.</p><p>The town’s “Firearms and More” store is its only landmark. You’ll pass and immediately turn left down a wooded road. (It’s private but everyone has permission.) You’ll drive across one creek, then its twin. The roads are doused in gravel, so you’ll want to drive slowly, with caution. You’ll soon see a lake, hardly a wild lake, but it’s big and holds lots of sky. You’ll want to park nearby. There’s a bridge. Cross that. You’ll see a small clearing ahead and a framed horse shed.</p><p>Bring your bike here — the one with the yellow handlebars. You’ll ride it in circles around the clearing with a borrowed baseball bat in hand. You’ll use the bat as a lance. You’ll smash dead branches from the dead tress, and you’ll chop the tops off the wild mushrooms. The shed will be locked. You could unlock it, but you won’t. There are only stirrups and stable helmets in there, anyway, and you don’t wear a helmet. When you get tired, you’ll pull threads from honeysuckle and bait them on fishhooks.</p><p>And you’ll pee a lot. You’ll pee on the trees. You pee next to the trees. You’ll pee on the shed. You’ll pee on the mushrooms. You’ll find a rusted Budweiser can half-buried next to the shed and pee on that too. You’ll pee on the barbed wire fence.</p><p>The barbed wire fence marks the edge of the property. There’s a meadow on the other side — a steer pasture where the grass grows with ticks. One day you’ll hop the barb-wired fence. There’ll be two redwing hawks overhead, beating their massive red-tipped wings, perfectly formed. You’ll buck on with them for a while; they too will be going south.</p><p class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\r\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\r\n\r\n</p><br>",

Read the abridged transcript below.</em></p><p><span id=\"more-1419\"></span></p><p>Colton Valentine: I wanted to start by asking you about the title of the poem. We have the speaker, Ruth Thalía, writing to you, the poet, but you’re the one actually writing. Is there some hidden commentary here on the poet and his subject matter or were you just channeling her voice?</p><p>Jacob Moscona Skolnik: This is actually the second poem in the series that I wrote using this voice of Ruth Thalía. She was the first contestant on a new game show in Peru called “The Value of Truth.”The way the show works is you have your person in the hot seat who is asked questions that get increasingly personal. As you answer the questions truthfully, you get more and more money. The objective is to keep answering questions with honest answers to accumulate money. So she’s the first contestant on this show—her family’s sitting right beside her—and she ends up admitting all these things: She has engaged in sexual activity for money; she doesn’t work where she told her parents she was working; she’s not actually in love with her boyfriend who’s sitting right there; she’s waiting for someone better. Long story short, the boyfriend, who’s humiliated on national television, ends up killing her.</p><p>One idea here was to have her writing to me—I’m a complete observer in this situation—to see what would happen if I use her voice and the way I understand all the dynamics at play in her voice. To see what happens when I address myself using that. Because obviously I’m not Peruvian; I’m not Hispanic. I’m adding all my own baggage from my life that’s unrelated to what’s going on. I wanted to make that explicit. I didn’t want to say that I’m going to come here into Peru and pretend to understand what’s going on. I wanted to make that distance really obvious and play with it.</p><p>C: So was this an attempt to get closer to her mind and her voice?</p><p>J: Potentially. It was also to try to figure out the relationship between her voice and my own even though in the poem the two obviously become mixed because I am writing it.</p><p>C: When did you first hear of Ruth Thalía?</p><p>J: I was watching this live. I was in Peru working when the show was starting, and it was huge. Everyone was so excited about this happening, and I was watching this thing with a friend in her house. After the show, there was a first round of publicity about the fact that she had admitted all these things, and then there was a second round of publicity about the fact that she was killed. Everywhere that you walked, you would see the equivalent of gossip magazines with her face on the front. It was bizarre.</p><p>C: One of our board members actually spent part of her last summer in Lima, and she talked about how the poem really captured the sense of the city. What were you doing there?</p><p>J: I was doing a couple things. I was working at a school that was set up near the heart of Lima to provide education for children with a very diverse array of disabilities. There were kids who were blind; there kids who were deaf; there were kids on crutches; there were kids with mental disabilities. A complete range. They were trying to divide them up into classrooms, but really what does that mean? I was doing that, and I was also working for Techo, which is an organization that arranges service projects in areas with high levels or urban poverty. I was frequently traveling out to these “Pueblos Jóvenes,” which are almost shanty towns on the outskirts of Lima. Very poor, urban communities. Part of the imagery comes from those areas, especially the second-to-last stanza, where you have these living structures that go right up to the edge of a highway. They continue back up onto these hills; these almost temporary-living structures just pile on top of each other.</p><p>C: This was last summer?</p><p>J: This was the summer before my freshman year, so two summers ago.</p><p>C: You said you’re not Peruvian, so what attracts you to Lima?</p><p>J: I’ve traveled a lot in South and Central American. The specific attraction to Peru is that my mom had lived there in the early eighties. She was doing medical work there, so I was living with a doctor and his wife that she had worked with thirty-plus years ago. Basically, I went with no particular agenda and ended up getting involved in these various projects and traveling around a little bit.</p><p>C: I love how this poem blends politics and aesthetics. You mention several different radical leftist groups—the FARC, sendero—and then capitalism. But it’s this white sphere. The work is always flitting with taking a political stance, but there’s all this irony and play: Capitalism is a jeopardy answer. What’s going on with all of that?</p><p>J: It’s difficult because when I write poetry my natural instinct is to tackle these big issues, these big problems. And it’s really easy when doing that, when talking about capitalism, to write things that become obvious, that have been written before, that come to not particularly meaningful conclusions, that are trite. What has helped me is taking these big ideas and not pretending that I’m coming to some dramatic conclusion in discussing them. Not saying: Capitalism is wrong, and it’s causing this problem—it has manipulated this woman through this game show and resulted in her death. To 1) not pretend I’m doing something huge with these things and 2) to make them really concrete. Which is kind of what I’m doing with capitalism—saying that it’s a sphere makes it easier to talk about. Once it’s something concrete, you can talk about that concrete thing. How does it feel? What does it look like? What’s going on? And allow that to give character to something like capitalism without explaining capitalism itself.</p><p>C: You mentioned wanting to shy away from a sort of conclusion or resolution on capitalism. The end, to me, seems to gesture toward some kind of resolution, but it is also is playing with perspective. Things were seen sideways in the past but now from above and below. Do you want it to strike as more dissonant or resolved?</p><p>J: I’m not really sure. I don’t think it really can be resolved in a satisfying way, in the same way that when someone dies in the way that Ruth Thalía dies—as a result of this game show—you can try to explain it. You can try to make sense of what’s going on. But you’re never going to really feel that you’ve come to a satisfying conclusion. I think it can go either way, but I definitely would not want someone to come away from this poem feeling like they found an answer or that it has come to a conclusion.</p><p>C: The sort of obvious addressee in this poem, from the title, is the poet. But I also felt like at certain times the “you”bordered on being the man who had killed her. Is that something that you were thinking about?</p><p>J: Interesting. I wasn’t thinking about that. The first poem in this series was her addressing the boyfriend, the guy who killed her. Potentially my writing that first poem had a trickle effect into this one.</p><p>C: How many poems are in the series?</p><p>J: So far, three, of which this is the second.</p><p>C: Is this something that you’re going to keep working on? Or do you feel like it’s a triplicate and that’s it?</p><p>J: I didn’t initially intend for it to be a series. I wrote the first one, and then Joshua Bell—I wrote this in his poetry class—suggested that I work with it. I wrote the second one because I found a new perspective that I thought would work. I don’t want to say that I will or I won’t. If I think of something that could benefit from using this voice, then I will.</p><p>C: Series are such an interesting idea in poetry because each poem has to stand on its own—and this one is being published by itself—but then they’re also working toward something larger. How do you see this as fitting into the larger project? Do you think it needs to do that? Or do they just treat a similar subject?</p><p>J: I think it can definitely stand alone. The images that are in this poem don’t need to follow from anything else. The poems are sort of additive; they just paint a more complete picture, but they can exist by themselves.</p><p>C: This poem has a very unusual form and physical appearance on the page. Some lines are indented; some groups of words are separated by extra spaces within a single line. Is there an intention behind that or did you just like how it looked?</p><p>J: I wanted to remove any formal structure: periods, commas, obvious line breaks, things like that. In part because the speaker isn’t really a person; she’s this dead voice that’s speaking from somewhere that’s not obvious or explained. Then I thought, how can I direct the way I want this to be read—the speed, the flow of the lines—in a way that someone would know what to do and how to read it without any punctuation. I came to this form in which the idea was to use space that would force a reader to subconsciously read it at a certain speed. Taking time at certain places. Putting emphasis on certain words. I just started writing it that way, and it really became easy to think of not lines or sentences in the traditional sense, but words and spaces as a way of directing the flow of the poem. It definitely doesn’t mimic him, but part of the inspiration for that came from Mayakovsky, who was a Russian poet before and after the Russian Revolution. What he did is—it’s hard to explain without seeing it graphically—but he used small line breaks and spaces to allow the display of the poem on the page to mimic speech patterns. Using actual spacing of words and lines to influence the way that the speed and flow works.</p><p>C: Right, instead of syntax, which is what you would normally use. Do you have any other main inspirations—not necessarily for this poem—but in general?</p><p>J: I have read a lot of early and mid-twentieth century Russian writers in translation. Another main influence is Lorca, who I’ve read in Spanish. Everybody loves Lorca so it feels weird to say Lorca, but he’s an inspiration for how I understand images to be most successful in poetry.</p><p>C: I thought about Lorca when I was reading this. Do you have a favorite poem by him?</p><p>J: Canción de Jinete is great. Romance Sonámbulo is another great one; it was also turned into a song. La Muerte is a lesser known one, but it’s kind of bizarre.</p><p>C: Is there anything else you want to say about this poem or yourself as the poet or Ruth Thalía? Or capitalism?</p><p>J: I guess this poem was in part my attempt to tackle these really big questions that I think everybody thinks about. But to try to do it in a way where you’re not coming to a big conclusion and you’re not pretending to do something that you’re not. But you just put these things out there, add imagery to it, and see what happens. See the emotions that can be evoked.</p><p class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\r\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\r\n\r\n</p>",

Most sources though, including the OED and user SeniorMoments of <a href=\"http://www.funtrivia.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.funtrivia.com</a>, seem to indicate it originates from English cricket in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century.  Supposedly, on a green day, a bowler knocked down three consecutive wickets – a feat, I am told – and the crowd took up a collection, using the proceeds to buy him a hat.</p><p>This is a charming tale, and I imagine all of the chimney-sweeps involved were quite pleased. But at <i>Notes from 21 South Street,</i> we’ve chosen “Hat Trick” for more than a cricket-themed set of pieces. For two fortnights, our aim is gasps, sparks, confusion, applause, and the return of the world to its Natural Order.</p><p><span id=\"more-1191\"></span></p><p style=\"text-align:center;\" rel=\"text-align:center;\"> *</p><p>Today other hat tricks might be seen on television: a European footballer cuts towards the goal, the ball wafts lazily from his instep, then hangs in the net behind a castrated keeper.</p><p>But the real moment of the hat trick is the pause while the truth washes over the crowd, dependent on all the speeds of light, sound, and neurons involved.  It’s when we look again to see that it-is-what-we-think-it-is-even-though-it-couldn’t-be.  The real watchers watch the reactions of the faces in the crowd.</p><p>A soccer player head-fakes as a magician misdirects, so that the keeper’s eyes are where he wants them.  Because if everyone is watching all the time, we can never have those moments of surprise, and tricks are never played. But sometimes you look away for a second and something happens — then you have to buy a round-trip ticket to the town where you had gym class.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">*</p><p>A philosopher might say that magic only exists in the mind of the perceiver –in the gap between expectations and reality. I would agree.  But I would add that it shares this gap with most emotions.  Jealousy, awe, sorrow, and disappointment happen when we expect one thing and get another. So a prestidigitation isn’t so different from: a surprise party, being stood up on a date, receiving sit-down-news from a doctor, a call from someone estranged, a kiss on the bench where you sit with your friends. The only thing is that sometimes the magician is: a. unwitting, b. an angel, c. no one at all.  <i>We</i> get to make magic.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">*</p><p>Another trick: a witch in Salem, cast into the water.  The town waits for her hat to rise.  Why are they afraid?</p><p>Once I saw a man place a baseball cap, inverted, on a table.  He would flip sideways over the table, with his head gracing its surface just enough to transfer the cap to his head, landing square besides.  There was clapping.  But there also was the split-second between the trick and the applause. It takes little to make us feel like a schoolboy, a cuckold, a Mary Magdalene, staring at the place where we thought something would be, but isn’t.</p><p>With tricks, the faces change only at the end. Pleasure from a trick comes, then, not from the confusion, but from its absolution.  And we are born again in a revelrous baptism at the sound of the gap being filled, the water rushing into the vacuum, returning the world to us and our state of presumed omniscience.</p><p class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\r\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\r\n\r\n</p>",

		"title" : "Review: Terrence Malick’s To the Wonder",
		"slug" : "2013-4-20-review-terrence-malicks-to-the-wonder",
		"body" : "<p>Since the WWII film <i>The Thin Red Line</i> (1998), all of Terrence Malick’s movies have opened with voice-overs that play on some form of the mythic invocation. The war film and <i>The New World</i> (2005) begin with appeals to a higher power, the former interrogating the mysterious relationship between being and (human) nature. <i>The Tree of Life</i> (2011) begins, after a quotation from the Book of Job, with Jack addressing the family members he will remember and reconstitute throughout the rest of the movie. The first lines of <i>The New World</i> follow the exhortative model of the classical invocation most explicitly: “Come, Spirit,” Pocahontas says. “Help us sing the story of our land. You are our mother, we your field of corn. We rise from out of the soul of you.”</p><p>In each of these cases, the voice-over, though spoken by a character anchored in the present of the narrative proper, calls forth a power or presence from beyond the temporal or spatial bounds of the plot. Rather than affecting the substantive action of the story, they accompany its unfolding and overhang its representations. In other words, they act much in the way that a prophecy is structured: they project a mode of thinking into the future events of the film by taking recourse to a higher (divine) authority, but, through their infinite re-interpretability, they can also be applied to a variety of events in mutually conflicting ways. When Private Train asks, at the beginning of <i>The Thin Red Line</i>, “What’s this war in the heart of nature?” his words clearly perforate more than just his experience in Guadalcanal or the soldiers’ encounter with the South Pacific flora and fauna. What these opening lines have in common, then, is that they all open an arena of interpretation overseen by a higher presence that is marked by two things: its absence, and, via its absence, a latent promise of events to come that will complicate or elucidate the reasons for its initial invocation.</p><p><span id=\"more-900\"></span></p><p>The first chapter of Malick’s newest film, <i>To the Wonder</i>, traces a fairly simple love story: Marina (Olga Kurylenko) is apparently an expatriate and struggling single mother in Paris, Neil (Ben Affleck) is apparently some sort of environmental rights worker from the United States, and, after they fall in love in France, she and her young daughter Tatiana return with him to Oklahoma (all of these details, though, even the characters’ names, are largely ambiguous, unstated or unexplored). The movie’s opening sequence both follows and breaks from the kind of invocatory beginning prevalent in Malick’s latest work. Marina speaks the opening lines over sequences of the couple, clearly romantically involved at this point, riding the TGV. Her voice-over comes from a point elsewhere than the moving train where the love story begins on screen, as she addresses Neil: “Newborn. I open my eyes. I melt. Into the eternal night. A spark. You got me out of the darkness. You gathered me up from earth. You’ve brought me back.” This opening invocation would appear to align with the beginning of <i>The Tree of Life</i>, in which Jack speaks,<i> “</i>Brother. Mother. It was they who led me to your door,” because Jack addresses another character who will appear in the film. But Jack appeals to his clouded memories of his deceased family members, not to loved ones we will observe him meeting as an adult, as Marina does. The connection between the biblical quotation and the opening line also summons a theological relationship and calls attention to actions still-to-come that will thicken this relationship with an interpretive grounding.</p><p class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 545px\" rel=\"width: 545px\"><a href=\"http://cinema-scope.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/The-Tree-of-Life.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" \" height=\"273\" src=\"http://cinema-scope.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/The-Tree-of-Life.jpg\" width=\"535\"></a></p><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Still from</em> The Tree of Life,<em> </em><em>Terrence Malick, 2011. Image courtesy of cinema-scope.com</em><br></p><p>Marina’s higher power-to-come exists firmly in the narrative, and the impulse behind her opening words does not lend itself to interpretations that stray too far from the substance of her speech. In her rhetorical form, she is impetuous, eliding verbs and conjunctions and using nouns as clumsy emblems of her salvation. Malick represents Marina’s hysterical dependence in her first line, and the balance of power in the relationship fully reveals itself when, after Marina and her daughter find Oklahoma disillusioning, Neil refuses to marry her when her visa expires and she returns to Europe. After this point, Tatiana largely disappears: for some reason, she is put under the custody of her father and seems to fall out of touch with her mother. This mother-daughter relationship seemed to be the film’s most promising one, as Tatiana had a sense early on that Oklahoma was not the answer for her family (“Something’s missing,” she whispers to her mother), but, like many promising details, it dissipates in the transition into the film’s next chapter. Marina, though, largely ignores her daughter’s advice, holding out hope that Neil would finally decide to marry her and thereby allow her to stay in the US. After Marina returns to Europe, Neil kindles a relationship with Anna (Rachel McAdams), a rancher who lost her first child, and subsequently her marriage, sometime in the past.</p><p>Neil, in one enigmatic sequence of him pondering his relationships, spins a crystal ball on a window sill and watches it revolve. It traces two spheres – the revolutions of the ball itself as it spins on its axis, and the oval path it traces on the sill in its movement. For all its allegorical significance, it is an apt image for the way relationships work in <i>To the Wonder</i>, because, incredibly, Marina and Anna both spend large portions of their time with Neil by whirling in circles a few paces ahead of him. We are told Marina is a former ballet dancer, as if that explains anything. Clearly, though, it does not – Anna, the experienced rancher, is just as susceptible to these twirling swoons. After her first child died, she says, her father told her to “Read Romans. All things work together for good.” She dismissed the advice, but somehow her relationship with Neil seems to validate the Scripture, to retroactively beatify all else she had experienced before. Anna, too, could have spoken the film’s opening lines. Her expressions of helpless devotion to Neil’s moods and indecision express the same sentiment.  The possibility of Salvation, to be “brought back,” is clearly foregrounded in the film, especially by Marina’s opening lines. It is a heady theme that promises, from its early establishment, that the rest of the film will thicken the characters of two women pigeonholed into a kind of permanent manic-dependent state. But Anna, too, is rebuffed by Neil with little explanation (in fact, he hardly speaks at all in the entire film). The women whirl and entreat, plead and desire, chatter and scream. Malick does not make much space for them to do anything else.</p><p class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 610px\"><a href=\"http://www.trbimg.com/img-516f1b55/turbine/sc-mov-0416-to-the-wonder-20130418-001/600/600x400\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://www.trbimg.com/img-516f1b55/turbine/sc-mov-0416-to-the-wonder-20130418-001/600/600x400\" width=\"600\"></a></p><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ben Affleck and Olga Kurylenko star in </em>To the Wonder<em>, Terrence Malick, 2013. Image courtesy of chicagotribune.com</em><br></p><p>Neil’s failing relationships are interspersed with scenes of Father Quintana (Javier Bardem), a Catholic priest, reciting sermons or walking through the poor neighborhoods and prisons of Oklahoma. He is clearly undergoing a religious crisis of theodicy, preaching to mostly empty pews about the necessity of loving God and making decisions in accordance with His will. He spends a great deal of his screen time peering into dilapidated houses but neglecting to knock on their doors, as if too ashamed or afraid to repeat these messages to the various disabled, poor and imprisoned figures who comprise, in montage, the problematic backdrop to the love story. One woman grabs his bible and tosses it into the grass, and, in the next sequence, he hides in his house as she calls for him to come to the door. The parallels between religious and spousal duty do not extend very far. Quintana and Neil are deeply unsettled by whom they serve and what values they prioritize, but the equation is troubling. Whether the ills of Oklahoma’s rural ghettos are meant to run alongside those of a luckless love, or the weak condolences of the Church are meant to be as pernicious as the indecisiveness of a man two women fall for, the representation of these links pit the beautiful cinematic representations of the romance against the darker images of the downtrodden. Malick’s cinematography, in other words, cannot help but push the images of societal rejects to the periphery of the romantic plot. These images’ relative narrowness – close shots of pained faces, lines of dingy homes, prisoners peering through bars – cannot accumulate enough energy to dislodge the romance, gorgeously filmed amidst the tides in Normandy, the streets of Paris, and the billowing fields of Oklahoma, from the film’s center.</p><p><i>To the Wonder</i> is marked by several stylistic moves Malick is famous for: the camera panning up to capture shafts of light broken by overhanging branches, the involuntary memory represented by jump cuts from a sense-perception to a remembered event (in <i>The Thin Red Line</i>, for example, Private Bell is transported back to sequences of moments with his wife when he feels the blades of grass rub against his body as he crawls toward an enemy bunker), and the edifice rendered uncanny for its isolation in a otherwise natural landscape. These series, like a reversal of the romantic fallacy that projects human emotions onto an a-human nature, soar above and leave behind the film’s sparse narrative and thematic content. The film’s aesthetic moments ultimately expose the weakness of their own foundation, like flying buttresses and leaping spires constructed on a corroded base. Malick’s movies so often achieve because they open, frequently at the outset, certain inquiries and problems that accompany the film’s subsequent images like preludes or overtures. In this sense, then, <i>To the Wonder</i> was doomed from its start.</p>",

Imagine now that your superpower is actually just extreme diligence, and that you are the director Richard Linklater. The product of this is <em>Boyhood</em>, a languorous dip into the formative years of a young boy in suburban Texas and a feat of filmmaking stamina. Its innovation was to film the same cast for a few days out of every year for twelve years, and for a time after seeing it I wondered whether its power rests solely in its gimmick. After all, <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2014/07/17/boyhood-gets-much-out-its-young-star-and-cinema-itself/yTixjbcHhCCOTKY2b8000I/story.html\"><em>The Boston Globe </em></a>had gone so far as to declare that it “may be why the movies were invented.” And yet, what it has to say about boyhood, or parenthood, or generalized personhood, resides squarely in the banal. It is the opposite of Terence Malick’s <em>The Tree of Life</em>, which situates its portrait of Texas boyhood in the context of nothing less than the incipient universe and the beginning of life on Earth. That film opens with a quotation from Job 38:4, 7 (“Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? …”) set to John Tavener’s “Funeral Canticle,” and ends with a surrealistic beachscape of the dead. <em>Boyhood</em> opens on a little boy cloud-watching to the strains of Coldplay’s “Yellow,” and ends with him, twelve years later, getting stoned in a national park.</p><p><span id=\"more-1471\"></span>“Life,” Linklater suggests, is better captured in a representative sampling than in extremes. It’s not your first day of school or even your mom’s second wedding so much as the time your dad took you bowling or the time in elementary school you were coerced into a terrible haircut. <em>Boyhood</em> doesn’t disregard the conventional logic that life rarely resolves organically into a compelling story so much as question whether a film needs a story at all. There are calamities, but they don’t begin to present themselves in the manner of a central quest or tension. The film maintains a tone that is purposely level. Dangers, for the most part, are subtle, and come to nothing. A scene where middle-school Mason (Ellar Coltrane) throws around a saw blade with friends seems destined to end with a skull split open, but doesn’t. In another he looks at a phone for three seconds too long while driving, as if to explain the impending crash that never happens. Still, <em>Boyhood</em> is a minor marvel. It feels like more than the sum of its parts—even though the part where Linklater films the same people over twelve years is clearly indispensable. Ultimately, what distinguishes <em>Boyhood</em> from time-lapse photography is its emotional stakes; what makes it different from novels is its visceral seamlessness. Through its condensed portrait of incremental change, the “gimmick” of time’s passage is anchored to a larger project; <em>Boyhood</em> moves by the inevitability of loss, if not the cunning of plot.</p><p>Multiple critics have suggested a slight disingenuousness to the movie’s title: protagonist Mason seems more an orbiting point for the lives of a whole cast of characters than a definitive central consciousness. Wai Chee Dimock in the <em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em> called it “steadfastly intersubjective… a crowdsourced modern epic, voluminous and interminable.” We follow Mason as he grows from a thoughtful kid who just wants to know if elves are real into a mellow, floppy-haired teen with his first job and serious girlfriend. But we also follow Mason’s sister Sam (Lorelei Linklater) with near-equal attention until she hits adolescence and leaves for college. We watch Mason’s mother, Olivia (Patricia Arquette) as she tries to make a better life for herself and her children. Along the way, she marries first a professor, then a student, both terrible husbands. Though Olivia is depicted mostly in struggling, we see the affable, fly-by-night Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) as his children probably do: with the non-custodial parent’s advantage of having fun time all the time. When he finally trades in the black Pontiac GTO for a baby-friendly minivan, Mason Sr. laments to his now-adult son that things didn’t work out between him and Olivia—he couldn’t be the kind of person he should have been when she needed him to be it. On the one hand, this is merely a reflection on the vicissitudes of time and relationships. And yet, one wonders whether the difference between Olivia and Mason Sr. was really that he wasn’t temperamentally capable growing up then, or if young mothers don’t tend to have a choice.</p><p>The film loosely transplants Linklater’s own boyhood into the experience of growing up in the 2000s, the autobiographic mapped onto the generic. Mason’s family draws heavily on Linklater’s: his parents were also separated; he too was primarily raised by his mom, who went back to school to study psychology when he was a boy. A birthday scene in which Mason receives a shotgun and monogrammed Bible from his step-grandparents corresponds to a real-life Christmas that Linklater calls his “redneck bar mitzvah.” But the film’s temporal identifiers are deliberately universal; there’s a way in which <em>Boyhood</em>‘s banal vision results in a banality of cultural reference. Ellar Coltrane and I share a birth year, and for anyone around our age <em>Boyhood</em> is an uncanny revisiting of pop cultural trivia we absorbed at our most impressionable and subsequently forgot. The soundtrack is a little bit like that feature of Spotify that says, “‘Somebody That I Used to Know’ was huge when you were a teenager. Play now?” Linklater enlisted his two young stars for help choosing the movie’s music, but their adolescent tastes turned out to be too specific: Ellar liked Rage Against the Machine and Lorelei liked harpsichord music. Insofar as <em>Boyhood</em> “happened” to me, it happened to almost every young-ish person in the Western world.</p><p>Linklater is interested in film for its capacity to preserve, but not to indulge the illusion that things never have to change. Rather, in <em>Boyhood</em>, art’s capacity to arrest time actually emphasizes time’s inexorability. It’s unclear whether Mason’s burgeoning love of photography is a stand-in for Linklater’s discovery of filmmaking, but the parallel is apt. The paradox of art plays out in the same way in Mason’s photography as it does in Linklater’s movie. In one scene, Mason and his high school girlfriend visit the University of Texas at Austin together, warm in the revelatory glow of first love. In the next, he dismantles a display of prize-winning photographs he’s taken of her. He lingers over them, we assume with affection, but it turns out to be closer to regret. We realise that their relationship has ended suddenly, bitterly, in the space between. And we are instantly disabused of the idea that successfully suspending something in time is any talisman against mutability.</p><p>The character who addresses the precariousness of time and circumstance most explicitly is Olivia. Her appearances at beginning and end gesture outside <em>Boyhood</em>‘s own temporal bounds. When we first see her, trying to explain to an unsympathetic boyfriend that as a single parent she has certain obligations, she exclaims exasperatedly, “I was somebody’s daughter, and then I was somebody’s fucking mother!” At the film’s close, Mason’s departure for college prompts a tearful reflection on the way life slips away imperceptibly, then stunningly: “Sending Sam off to college, sending you off to college… You know what’s next? Huh? It’s my fucking funeral!” But the moment is precluded from puncturing the film’s general weightlessness by Olivia’s self-consciously comic hysteria and Mason’s response, the unperturbed riposte of youth: “Aren’t you skipping ahead by, like, 40 years?” (He has a point: by the temporal logic of this film, the part where she dies ought to be a solid 10 hours away.)</p><p>This is because <em>Boyhood</em> bears Linklater’s imprint in temperament as well as autobiographical content. As much as is possible for a work of art primarily concerned with the changes—good and bad—wrought by time, <em>Boyhood </em>remains a vehicle for a fundamentally benevolent view of the universe. One minor character occurs and recurs seemingly solely to demonstrate that even the smallest acts of kindness bear life-affirming fruit. Olivia tells a handyman fixing her pipes that he’s too smart not to go to college. Years later, having taken her advice, he reappears with pleasing symmetry as the manager of the upscale restaurant where Mason’s graduation lunch is taking place. But Linklater’s optimism is rendered on a much larger scale, too: given Mason’s itinerant upbringing and the complete dearth of satisfying models of male responsibility, he turns out reassuringly well adjusted and serene. Jesse Barron observed at <a href=\"https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/reviews/life-events/\"><em>n+1</em></a> that Mason remains “[oddly] unaffected by his own growing up… [he] occasionally looks like a teenager who won a contest in a mall and has been invited to appear on a reality show.” Malcolm Harris at <em>T<a href=\"http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/boy-2-man/\">he</a></em><a href=\"http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/boy-2-man/\"> <em>New Inquiry</em></a> criticized it as Linklater lacking the courage of his own portents; in the troubled landscape of contemporary American boyhood, with its “foreshadows of violence and cruelty… Linklater declares victory too early.” It’s certainly possible that individuals could have Mason’s childhood and not be damaged by it. But its cherry-picking of the most popular of pop culture suggests that in some way it seeks to be a topography of communal experience, too, and in that regard it falls short.</p><p>Still, I’m more sympathetic to <em>Boyhood</em>‘s approach. Linklater is, after all, the director who made <em>Dazed and Confused</em> and <em>School of Rock</em>, the consummate cineaste of goofy stoner philosophizing, and he wants you to have a good time. It’s a film of many pleasures: consistently funnier than a good deal of comedies, it provides an affectionate and naturalistic rendering of its characters, especially children. Though Olivia’s outburst near the film’s end presents us with mortality, we aren’t allowed to linger on it too long. Instead, we are swept away by Mason’s enthusiasm as he savours his first taste of the freedoms that college brings. <em>Boyhood</em> depicts loss and change because that’s what life is like. But in Linklater’s universe that only adds to the beauty of it all, as he burnishes to high shine memories we might otherwise discount.</p>",

It is perhaps because art-making is necessarily a deeply personal practice; understanding an artist’s body of work in its entirety requires that we put him in the context of history, in relation to the city that he lived and worked, the people that he conversed with, and the works of art from which he drew inspiration. Naturally it’s difficult to pin down the factors that transformed artists as who they are now. The cliché that each human being brings a universe of his own resonates profoundly with artists. But if art-making is a personal pursuit in the end, where one has to carve his own path for creativity, what does it mean to study art in an institutional setting? Can art be taught?<br>\r\n<span id=\"more-1617\"></span></p><p class=\"p1\">Berlin-based artist Matt Saunders thinks so. A graduate of Harvard’s Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) program, he went on to study at Yale and moved to Germany in 2002. Now he’s back in Cambridge, teaching painting and printmaking along with his former teachers. I met up with Matt in Berlin, in his well-lit studio in Prenzlauer Berg and his favorite restaurants in Mitte, to discuss what it means to study and teach painting.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/harvardundergrad-polaroid-scan.jpg\"><img alt=\"HarvardUndergrad Polaroid scan\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1619\" height=\"694\" src=\"https://theadvocateblogdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/harvardundergrad-polaroid-scan.jpg?w=670&h=694\" width=\"670\"></a></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Polaroids from undergraduate VES studio, circa 1996-97</em></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Harry Choi: Did you come to Harvard thinking that you’d like to study art? </strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Matt Saunders: Not particularly. I came here thinking that I would do something along the lines of philosophy, and I don’t think I was even aware of the VES department. Of course I was interested in art, but I knew that I wanted to end up in a university instead of an art school. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>HC: Why was that? </strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">MS: The idea of an art school, where you go through rigorous “traditional” training, didn’t appeal to me as a high school senior. Two semesters of drawing followed by two semesters of painting, that kind of rigid curriculum. I felt like the most interesting work for me didn’t come from that direction.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>HC: What kind of works were you interested in when you first started making art?</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">MS: I signed up for art classes in middle school after going to the National Gallery of Art and being fascinated with Jasper John’s painting <i>Fool’s House</i> . I grew up in Baltimore; I wouldn’t say that I was “surrounded” by art in my childhood, but also found a lot of support there once I looked.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>HC: Then you came here and studied with Ellen Phelan, who is very much a “pure” painter. </strong><strong>How was it to study painting as an undergraduate in the late 90s? What was going on in the department?</strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">MS: I didn’t really take much in the way of painting courses as an undergraduate; it was just before Nancy Mitchnick came in. (Nancy really occupied the painting studios and brought them to life.) I was taking classes in printmaking, 2-D/ 3-D Design and photography. I did a little bit of painting in Annette Lemieux’s class, but it was my thesis project that really got me into the practice of painting. It was a series that I developed out of the printmaking work that I was doing at the time. I started working closely with Ellen Phelan.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She is someone who really changed my life. Ellen received that very rigorous, old-school art education, but structured her classes much more loosely. She introduced the notion of skills and technical knowledge not being an end by themselves, but as part of a bigger practice that you build as an artist. She didn’t believe in hierarchizing the learning of art but still – more than is often in vogue – taught some real skills.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>HC: What about VES was formative in your personal development as an artist?</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">MS: VES was a fantastic balance between medium-specific skills and the flexibility to play around with ideas. I really thrived in that unstructured environment; it helped me figure out my own voice, and find my way through the various interests I had, from art history to early books to film. And because my paintings were a way of putting together these interests, I was able to think a lot about what it meant to be a painter in a period when it had been historically uncool. Then there was a resurgence of painting in New York in the late 90s and early 2000s, with artists like John Currin, Elizabeth Peyton, and Amy Sillman receiving more attention. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>HC: Was it the department’s direction that informed your practice as a young artist? Or was it the general current of history that produced such an atmosphere on campus?</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">MS: It’s a bit of both. There was something about Harvard in general that affected me. At the time (I’d hazard perhaps more so than now) there was a great emphasis on a liberal arts education. The whole line about learning how to think was very palpable in the atmosphere. I went to school in the middle of the Clinton era, when the American economy was booming, and people were relatively relaxed about life after college. I think that was one reason why I was able to focus on developing my work practice. It’s not like I wasn’t concerned about my future; I was freaking out about everything, but I think deep inside I knew I could be alright.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>HC: How was it to study painting in that strange era of painting renaissance? Yale MFA’s division along disciplines is quite notable in that regard; what was going on in the painting program? </strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">MS: I decided to go to Yale instead of Columbia because Yale gave me the precise challenge of putting my work in the context of painting, though Columbia was seemingly more in sync with my interests: it was a smaller program that had more interdisciplinary offerings. Going to Yale meant that I would be sharing studio space with twenty-or-so people that self-identified as painters. And it was quite exciting to think about that—although my work was, and still is, very much informed by painting, I didn’t really know a lot of pure painters. My friends from VES were making all different kinds of work. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I  was working on paintings at first, transitioned into film and photography for a little bit, and then worked on paintings for my final show. At Yale I developed more foundations for my practice. I was interested in making things by hand, and maintaining a balance between on one hand caring about and picking up the tools of painting, but on the other letting work be medium free, self-directed and open-ended.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>HC: And is it something that you keep in mind as you teach painting as well?</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">MS: Very much so. I believe that you develop your ideas just as much through distracted time or working in seemingly non-productive ways.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You do your best thinking when you’re not trying to think. You often just need to pick up something and do it, because it’s a good use of your time and it can lead to many wonderful things. And the best way to get around to art-making in college is to sign up for art classes and do these assignments. And they are not stupid because you can do something else with them. It’s much better than locking yourself up thinking that you’re good at something and remaining at that level without challenging yourself. You end up becoming bad at it because you identify with your talent too much. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>HC: How do you envision your role as a teacher? What are your goals and aspirations?</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">MS: After I graduated from college, I worked as a teaching assistant for a VES thesis workshop that Peter Schjeldahl taught. And he said something quite memorable: “All of the artists that I knew were terrible students, so you all must be terrible artists.” </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Of course this sounds cliché and abrasive, but it’s not entirely untrue. I want to help students understand that the straight road is often not the best road; learning how to become an artist is a totally different thing because you shouldn’t be doing what everyone else is doing. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>HC: And now that you’ve finished formal education and now teaching students, what do you think was the most important factor in your development as an artist?</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">MS: Really, the most important thing is time. I remember living in New York when I was twenty-five, and thinking that I was ready for prime time, when I was <i>really</i> not. You go through cycles of life, for me every five years or so, and in each cycle you have different passions and obsessions. And learning how to become an artist is learning the intensity of it—making bad work, looking back at your bad work, but somehow continuing to make things. You can’t write the great novel thinking that you’re going to write the great novel. That’s what I would like to tell any young artist.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Images courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.ves.fas.harvard.edu/saunders.html\"> Matt Saunders</a></em><br></p><p class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\r\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\r\n\r\n</p>\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

I hope you enjoy “The Washing Room II” and the following interview.</i></p><p><em>– Kevin Hong ’15</em></p><p><span id=\"more-1247\"></span></p><p>Harvard Advocate: Why did you choose to write in vignettes?</p><p>My Ngoc To: I think it’s because it was the structure that best portrayed my story. Because there wasn’t one large story that could describe what I was going through, I wanted each story to focus on a different part of my life. And not even my life, but other people’s lives. I feel like <i>The Washing Room</i> is not something that happens once, or that you can follow with a line. It happens everywhere with everyone. Everyone gets dirty, everyone gets hurt.</p><p>HA: Do you think about the previous features you’ve written when you start a new one?</p><p>MNT: Actually, this book was kind of inspired by my time writing for <i>The Advocate</i>. “The Washing Room” was the first feature I ever wrote for <i>The Advocate</i>, and it was my first solid piece of writing. How this book came to be is that after I took my gap year, I came home and I felt like I had a story that had a happy ending and needed to be shared with people. I actually wrote a book that was in chronological order, that had a much more, you know, “typical” storyline. But it just didn’t feel right. I hated it, so I dropped it. During spring break I came back to it and took only the best chapters and then I combined it with all this other stuff that I wrote for <i>The Advocate</i>; I juxtaposed them in a way that made sense. And then I realized that this was the book that I was looking for.</p><p>HA: Do you think that <i>The Advocate</i> played this role in your book just by chance, or that there was something else at work?</p><p>MNT: I’m not sure if it was by chance. I comped the Features Board my freshman fall and got in; I actually wrote “The Washing Room” during my comp and it was something I was really proud of. For the first time in my life I felt that I was writing something solid and substantial. It was really exciting because somehow, I think, I entered a new stage of growth and development in my writing. And it probably came from being around so many other people who read and write well. I think I got inspiration from it without realizing it.</p><p>HA: Is your book in conversation with other authors who write about the immigrant experience?</p><p>MNT: I actually haven’t read too much immigrant literature. The only thing I can really remember is like Amy Tan, or something like <i>The Kite Runner.</i> But a lot of people who have read it told me they could really relate to my stories, because they too were immigrants, or their parents were immigrants. Or if they’re not immigrants they have been in situations when they felt alienated.</p><p>The book is called <i>The Washing Room: A Story of Stories. </i>“A Story of Stories” is the first essay I ever wrote on my family, my parents’ background. That was in the tenth grade, when I had an amazing English teacher; I guess she saw something in me and really encouraged me to write more.</p><p>HA: Are there any memoirists that have influenced your writing?</p><p>MNT: I’m less influenced by memoir writers than by poetry … After I read <i>The Tao</i> I became really fascinated by this really impressionistic way of portraying things. <em>The Tao</em> is basically a bunch of poems and vignettes and together they make something a lot bigger because they’re not confined by a strict architecture.</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px;line-height:1.5;\">The quotes I put in the book are basically by writers who have influenced me the most. Rumi, Rilke — I also like Toni Morrison a lot and Augusten Burroughs, who wrote </span><i>Running with Scissors</i><span style=\"font-size:14px;line-height:1.5;\">. I liked how completely honest he was and how he wasn’t afraid to show himself in very bad states. It also encouraged me to be a bit humorous in my writing. I wouldn’t call it a work of humor, but some places were funny, I think.</span></p><p>HA: What is it to write a memoir at such a young age?</p><p>MNT: Yeah, it is weird. When I tell people that I’m writing a memoir, they’re like, “You’re too young to write a memoir.” That’s why I kind of don’t want to call this a memoir, because it’s not about my “life.” I haven’t been through the typical things people in their sixties write about. I’m not famous, I’m not <i>blah</i>. The reason I wanted to write this in the first place is that I felt I had a story. The fact that it’s based on my experiences is why it has to be categorized as a memoir. But I’m really just trying to paint a picture. It’s more like “a story from a real person.”</p><p>HA: “The Washing Room II” is preceded by a Morrison quotation. Can you read it?</p><p>MNT: It’s from <i>The Bluest Eye</i>. The quote is very dreamy; it describes how I felt after I walked out of the Advocate building; at a point of recovery from something that still lingers.</p><p><i>Sunk in the grass of an empty lot on a spring Saturday, I split the stems of milkweed and thought about ants and peach pits and death, and where the world went when I closed my eyes.</i></p><p>HA: Where can one purchase your book?</p><p>MNT: <em>(Laughter) </em>If you’re friends with me, you can email me and ask. You can also get it from the Harvard Book Store and order it online. Kindle versions will be available … at some point. <em>(Laughter)</em> By the end of November.</p>",

Smaller white mounds of salt dry under a blinding sun that burns black skin even blacker. From up here, I can’t see the sweat on the brows of the workers – mostly women, some with babies strapped to their backs – nor the cracked skin of hands and feet rubbed raw by millions of tiny, jagged crystals. The corrosive power of the salt eats through metal pans used to scoop the saline water, turning them first to rust, then flakes, then dust.</p><p>The women down there gather salt by hand into 110-pound sacks, which sell for about $2 or are traded for sugar with neighboring Gambia, where salt is mainly used to preserve fish in areas without electricity. Trade is informal and vendors elude corrupt tax and customs officials by slipping through the maze of mangrove swamps along the liquid border, exchanging goods between wooden canoes in the hidden shallows.</p><p>The scale of my aerial view dwarfs such toil on the salt flats leading out to sea, a view interrupted only by clusters of ragged palm trees that shade thatched village huts dotting the coastline. Out there, the sea, too, reflects the sun, glinting hard and white over a vast, rippling emptiness. But far below my feet, in those murky pools, color glows from the earth. And people scratch a living from it.</p>",

Fever is a nightmarish house party that leaves the body ravaged and scarred from the inside out.” Perhaps he is right. But our true demon is not so gregarious. It arrives quietly, and it takes root. It is heralded not by the furious tremors of a coming surge, but by the ominous toll of a sluggish hour. The tick of a clock. The heavy sigh. The restless fluttering of an impatient foot.</p><p>In his autobiography, Roland Barthes recalls “A panic boredom, to the point of distress: like the kind I feel in panel discussions, lectures, parties among strangers, group amusements: wherever boredom can be seen. Might boredom be my form of hysteria?” His pairing of boredom with madness is not new. The thought crosses millennia of literary musing, philosophical inquiry and spiritual belief. Boredom, whether conceived as a critical attunement, psychological state, existential <i>malaise</i>, physical impairment, scholarly illness or personal weakness, was once thought to afflict those beset by a demonic envoy called acedia. Evagrius the Solitary, the fourth century Christian Desert Father, first described the fiend. Evagrius lived amidst his fellow monks in the Desert of Cells, the desolate sprawl of arid land south of Alexandria, and he envisioned a demon that latched itself to pious minds at the very moment the sun had reached its apex, when the hottest hour seemed to drag for an eternity, when the temptations of modern life in Alexandria sang out most plaintively. Distracted and disgusted with their repetitive work — the copying of scripture, the weaving of reed baskets — the monks lapsed and gave into their demons. Their boredom was a failure before God.</p><p><span id=\"more-827\"></span></p><p>Acedia, the worst of Evagrius’ Eight Evil Thoughts, was the most perfidious of all sins. When John Cassian, one of Evagrius’ students in North Africa, brought the principles of desert monasticism to fifth century Marseilles, the demon followed. “This is akin to dejection,” he writes, lamenting the sometimes agitated, sometimes listless condition of his disquieted monks, “especially disturbing to a monk about the sixth hour, like some fever which seizes him at stated times, bringing the burning heart of its attacks on the sick man at usual and regular hours.” A regular fever, acedia: a virus bound to its human vessel by the very monotony of his repeated tasks, a possession without the sweet delirium of a reverie, without the excitement of a skirmish of the soul.</p><p>“It renders him slothful and immobile in the face of all the work to be done,” Cassian continued. “It does not allow him to stay still in his cell or to devote any effort to reading.” His followers were not beset by desert heat or self-imposed isolation. They lived amidst one another, with communal values and shared tasks, in the relative comfort of an enclosed monastery in the south of France. Yet their attention wandered, their spiritual pursuits constantly frustrated by a dull dissatisfaction with the ordinary, the familiar, the interminable tasks of everyday life. Their work was divided between physical tasks and mental demands. Concentration became a virtue of the elite, the disciplined, and the holy, while distraction signaled the sick, the lazy, and the weak-willed.</p><p>Through the first millennium, Cassian’s acedia evolved into many different forms, notably becoming pathologized, exorcised of its demonic undertones, during the Renaissance. It became <i>melancholia</i>, the excess of black bile, the bilious byproduct of overworked scholars and frustrated alchemists, and, when made visible, an elitist expression of unbridled genius and tortured creativity. But has the illness been eradicated? How long does the demon reign?</p><p>In 2010, two scientists at the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health published a study that found, based on the responses to a 1980s questionnaire of London civil servants, that “those who report being bored are more likely to die younger than those who are not bored.” Perhaps they were also right to conclude that “the state of boredom is almost certainly a proxy for other risk factors,” a gateway mood to self-destructive behaviors and unhealthy habits. But perhaps boredom is more maddening than madness. It’s what makes us cry out for something to rekindle our belabored minds. In a single turn, fever becomes our guardian. It is the violent storm breaking doldrums’ spell. And it is good.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\" rel=\"text-align:center;\">♠</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>TWO</strong></p><p>When I was small I went to church every Sunday. It was a late Mass, comparatively, starting at 10:30 am, and yet we always seemed to be late. Hair ties askew and Mary Janes unbuckled, we’d slink into the nave amid the opening hymn, nudging through the pews to where my grandmother had saved us a spot, knowing we’d arrive at some point. She needed to save a spot: the services were fuller then.</p><p>I never minded the songs and readings; the homilies usually held my attention. But it was barely 11:00 when the priest tucked his notes back into his robes and descended from the lectern. Forty-five minutes remained (this Mass was late but long): forty-five minutes that, every Sunday, were inexorably the same. Preparation of the Gifts; Prayer over the Gifts; Preface Dialogue; the Holies and Acclamations and Prayers. I knew exactly what was coming and exactly how long it would take to get there — an excruciating knowledge when trapped within a pew. I usually hadn’t eaten anything, so there was also that wide, gaping ache of morning hunger, freezing my circulation before it made it to my fingers and toes. The incense made me woozy as the congregation muttered together, words whose cadence I could mimic but whose meaning I could only guess at until, later, I would see the prayers themselves written out in confirmation class. Time unrolled like a thick skein of yarn, caught in its own snags. I was endlessly, mindlessly bored.</p><p>In a certain sense, of course, this was the point. There is a relief in ritual, a comfort in repetition. Amid the cacophony of modern life, to chant is to withdraw, seeking solace detached from thought.</p><p>Boredom, then, succeeds at this precise detachment. In the medieval period, professor Stephen Greenblatt tells us in <i>The Swerve, </i>monasteries occupied an uncertain position: they were the repositories of knowledge, the copiers of ancient texts, but also the champions of a precise catechism that left little room for intellectual questioning. Monks were meant to copy down manuscripts letter by letter, without thinking, without debating the terms of ancient thought. The rooms were always silent but for the scratching of their quills. Inevitably, then, the monks would slip into lethargy. Quite simply, they were bored. Priests in charge called this the “noonday demon,” an acedia springing precisely from the prayerful reading to which the monks were meant to subscribe. Here in the monasteries, holy contemplation could easily become mechanical boredom; the difference between the two was indeed negligible.</p><p>We’ve become very good at negating the need to think about this distinction. “Prayerful reading” in a secular age has detached itself, to a certain extent, from the confines of medieval cloisters, finding its way into meditation and self-help rather than into the rituals of a Mass. Boredom has, some might say, been similarly banished. We have lost one of our country’s most fervent surveyors of this phenomenon in the death of David Foster Wallace, who as a child watched six hours of television per day. “Not just Muzak in dull or tedious places anymore,” he wrote in his unfinished <i>The Pale King, </i>“but now also actual TV in waiting rooms, supermarkets’ checkouts, airports’ gates, SUVs’ backseats. Walkmen, iPods, BlackBerries, cell phones that attach to your head.” People seek stimulation, Wallace suggests, to distract them from a deeper kind of pain than “dullness.” We have, he claimed — because he saw it in himself — a profound fear of silence, of shutting out the noise. Because perhaps once we do the reality of things will rear its terrifying head, and we will have to face whatever it is that the clamor drowns out.</p><p>What if boredom becomes necessary, though — impossible to escape? In some ways <i>The Pale King </i>is an attempt to follow this proposition to its the logical conclusions. In the stale monotony of the Midwestern IRS, its employees seem to want to go crazy but somehow cannot. Lane Dean pictures himself running around during his ten-minute break with ten cigarettes in his mouth, speaking in tongues, waving his hands; but he spends the break sitting, facing the clock, counting the seconds until he goes back to work. One whole chapter is composed of characters turning the page (literally: “She turned the page. He turned the page.” Pages and pages of this.).</p><p>But there is, Wallace seems to suggest, a certain nobility in what the IRS employees must achieve. “To function effectively in an environment that precludes everything vital and human. To breathe, so to speak, without air.” If you can become comfortable with boredom, live with it, you will, according to Wallace, be alright. As he said in his famous Kenyon commencement address, it is this embrace of boredom, the unsexy embrace of awareness in the everyday (<i>this is water—this is water)</i>, that makes getting through each moment possible, and worth it.</p><p>To strip down the noise, to face the threat lurking under boredom’s surface, and to emerge on the other side: These become the pillars of a new kind of catechism. It is a catechism that embraces boredom both in its superficial dullness and its existential despair. Boredom, when used correctly, becomes not a detractor from meaning but a prerequisite for the same. As scholar Michael Raposa has written, it is a metaphorical midwife: the “pallid half-darkness that sometimes lingers” before the dawning of the light. Boredom is thus elevated to a spiritual plane, one embedded in the <i>The Pale King</i>’s prose — even if Wallace himself ultimately couldn’t subscribe to the framework he so articulately mapped out.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">♣</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>THREE</strong></p><p>Jørgen Leth and Ole John’s film <i>66 Scenes from America</i>, created in 1981, includes a “tableau” called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejr9KBQzQPM\" target=\"_blank\">“Burger, New York.”</a> Seated at a long, black table in front of a dull, gray wall, Andy Warhol removes a Burger King Whopper box from its paper bag, opens it, unwraps the burger, and briefly struggles with getting ketchup out of a glass bottle of Heinz onto the wrapper (“It doesn’t come out,” he mutters). Warhol then proceeds to eat the hamburger, dipping it into the ketchup every so often; halfway through the 4’30” minute scene, he removes the top of the bun and folds the rest of the burger in half, and after four more bites Warhol puts it down. He wipes his mouth and tidies up, and after close to a minute of silence, says to the camera: “Uh, my name is Andy Warhol and, uh, I just finished eating uh, a hamburger.”</p><p>Watching the king of pop do anything on television is, at first, amusing. That’s the point. We watch the most mundane task all the way through because the artist has attained a celebrity status. There’s an element of absurdity, too, that Leth, John and Warhol would take on such a filmic production. And perhaps something grotesque about it as well, a kind of cannibalism — the “consumer artist” consuming one of the most prevalent consumer products. On top of this, the camera digests this scene for the audience’s viewing pleasure. If “cannibalism” is too strong a word, then we might at least agree on “oversaturation”: Warhol the icon represents the American individual steeped in — better yet, soaked through by — the commercial market.</p><p>It is, ironically, this oversaturation that produces the boredom that we eventually feel, that we see Warhol feeling, that permeates the long, black table and the dull, gray wall. The commercial world’s assault on the consumer, originally a source of stimulation, distraction, temptation, satisfaction, results in numbness. We are bored of this bombardment and yet continue to go through the motions, conditioned, like Pavlov’s dog, to salivate whenever we see the phrase “I’m lovin’ it” — a phrase forever linked to the crunch of a golden chicken nugget.</p><p>Warhol eats, but he does not <i>enjoy</i> what he eats; his chewing is accompanied by a deadpan stare. If his boredom wasn’t apparent before, it clearly shows when he takes half the bun off the hamburger, wanting to finish as quickly as possible. We realize suddenly that Warhol’s final statement is slightly, but crucially, untrue. He says, “I just finished eating, uh, a hamburger,” but there are several bites that he leaves on his wrapper, which he crumples up and throws away. He doesn’t finish the hamburger; what he means to say is that he’s finished <i>with</i> the hamburger. Warhol’s boredom verges on disgust and results in waste.</p><p>The metaphor of the consumer is apt because, just as we can get full from food, we can feel overloaded by brands and advertisements. We might call it “oversatisfaction” — the nauseating or soporific sensation of the “food coma” is akin to the glaze that comes over one’s eyes while looking through the tabloids at the grocery store. “Burger, New York” hints at the former but depicts the latter: The reason Warhol doesn’t finish the burger isn’t that he’s physically full; rather, he’s put off by the idea of continuing on, of consummating the act of utter non-satisfaction. This is not yet disgust, for disgust would be real emotion, outside boredom’s realm. Instead, Warhol’s nausea triggers the question, “Should I finish this hamburger?”, the answer being another question, “Do I care?”</p><p>The only glimmer of personality shows toward the beginning of the scene, when Warhol shakes the bottle of Heinz, muttering, “It doesn’t come out.” This frustration, though, is coupled with a wry grin from the artist, as if he’s glad to be shaken from his doldrums. Dissatisfaction is a flicker of life, an ironic pleasure quickly smothered by more concentrated boredom.</p><p>From oversaturation to non-satisfaction we come full-circle. I’m reminded of a piece of panda trivia I learned from a zookeeper at the San Diego Zoo: She said, in effect, that a panda excretes what it eats. To be clear: Its waste is literally a heap of chewed-up bamboo. In essence, the act of consumption is the only thing that distinguishes a panda’s food from its shit. Content to pulverize bamboo for what little nutrition it provides and to sleep, energyless and alone, for the rest of the day, pandas are probably one of the most bored creatures on the planet. We, too, wait for the next meal, following Warhol’s lead, his face stretched like cellophane, his hair bleached into oblivion.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">♥</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>FOUR</strong></p><p>Rather than reflect on Facebook’s monopolization of contemporary boredom, as I was initially inclined to do, I’d like to look back at boredom’s pre-digital manifestations. Two historical prototypes capture my interest, each gendered, and both ripe for what Heidegger called a “confrontation with time”: the male soldier and the domestic female.</p><p>In her recently published book, <i>Modernism, Feminism, and the Culture of Boredom</i>, Allison Pease suggests that much of literary modernism was essentially shaped by female boredom. She claims that illustrating bored women characters was a way for writers of the early 1900s, like Woolf, Richardson and Sinclair, to voice their discontent with a suffocating gender-hierarchy. Female boredom was a very real phenomenon, instigated by very real societal subordination; to depict it in fiction, Pease argues, was a form of political dissent.</p><p>While literature from the early twentieth century presented a feminine species of boredom, a masculine species thrived elsewhere. In <i>Enduring Military Boredom: From 1750 to the Present</i>, Bard Maeland and Paul Otto Brunstad verify via historical case study the cheeky factoid that military service is 99% boredom and 1% terror. The book reveals that boredom did not belong to the ottoman alone; the vacuous sentiment haunted many a soldier waiting in a trench for his next employment or undergoing a long journey via submarine.</p><p>A condition of the same name afflicted he who represented his nation and she who was denied the right to take part in it. Boredom in these histories is no negative vacuum; rather, it is embedded within politics and lies at the heart of war and the family structure.</p><p>In the late nineteenth century, greater access to education had provided women with the intellectual means to succeed, but political and social constraints prevented them from so doing. Pease suggests that it was this growing tension between a woman’s internal self-realization and her steady external repression that resulted in boredom. Not only were women forced to remain inactive, Pease further proposes, but they willingly submitted themselves to recumbence as a form of respite: In <i>The Pastor’s Wife</i>, Elizabeth von Armin writes, “Ingeborg’s mother had found the sofa as other people find salvation …. she had simply discovered in it a refuge.” Along these lines, Austrian psychoanalyst Otto Fenichel diagnoses pathological boredom as the state that arises when a “subject seeks to be freed by means of a <i>passive</i> experience from a tension which set in because he was afraid of his own <i>active</i> impulses.” A woman’s energy was directed into passive boredom when her inner desire to act was unsatisfied by the outside world.</p><p>Not unlike the housewife, the soldier is appointed a specific social place. War suspends his agency, donning him responsibility and purpose. But not always is his purpose called to task: While the soldier is often busy, he is also often not. In a sketch of Private John Ball waiting for the Battle of the Somme, David Jones writes: “a penetrating tedium, a boredom that leadened and oppressed, making the spirit quail and tire, took hold of them, as they went to their first fatigue.” The image of the bored soldier is striking: One assumes, wrongly, that the meaningful title of <i>soldier</i> immunizes its beholder from feelings of listlessness. As Maeland and Brunstad report, consigned young men found the reality likewise striking. While one young man, for example, sought “the tickle of being close to death in order to combat his existential emptiness and boredom,” he soon discovered the same boredom in the trenches where he awaited that deathly tickle.</p><p>For both the female domestic and the male combatant, boredom, even when engendered of specific circumstance, bore existential consequence. Reinhard Kuhn says chillingly of the housewife’s ennui that “this is a condition that has no foreseeable or inevitable end but death.” The connection to the soldier here — whose boredom is literally broken by deathly engagement — is clear. Leonard Woolf suggests moreover that the soldier’s waiting would not be cured by the resumption of action, insofar as the act of waiting simply revealed the “negative emptiness and desolation of personal and cosmic boredom” that characterized the war in totality. In this vision, boredom is not a temporary sentiment, but rather a pathological state that alludes to life’s conclusive stillness.</p><p>While boredom may remind us of the end, however, it need not itself <i>be</i> the end. Indeed, boredom is often conceived of as a progenitor of creativity. In the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald, “Boredom is not an end-product, is comparatively rather an early stage in life and art. You’ve got to go by or past or through boredom, as through a filter, before the clear product emerges.” For Virginia Woolf and May Sinclair, Fitzgerald’s words ring true. And even the soldier was known to have creative breakthroughs, though his measures were often desperate. I will end with a section from Paul Fussell’s <i>In The Great War and Modern Memory</i> that illustrates one such creative breakthrough. The episode, which depicts an American POW in a German Stalag, is both familiar and alien; it calls to mind how universal and recognizable boredom is, how contagious it can be, and how curious are its expressions:</p><p> “[He] counted the barbs in one section of the barbed wire fence and then estimated the total number of barbs around the encampment. When he announced this number, his fellow kriegies not only didn’t consider him mad, they formed teams to check him out with a barb-by-barb count.”</p><p class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\r\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\r\n\r\n</p>\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

That same year, British philosopher Nick Bostrom carried <i>The Matrix</i>‘s threat out of movie theaters and into philosophy departments, publishing “Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?” Looking at the past growth of computing power, Bostrom raises the possibility that we are living in a simulated universe generated by an extremely powerful computer, which in turn might itself exist within yet another simulation, ad infinitum and ad nauseum. This skeptical worry along with a few related variations have come to be known as “simulation arguments.”</p><p><span id=\"more-1167\"></span></p><p>Philosophers often compare Bostrom to Descartes, arguing that the simulation argument is simply the dream argument — “Are we living in a dream?” — outfitted in the silicon trappings of the computer age. The similarity, certainly, is difficult to overlook. In a similar vein, we can view Dan Ashwood’s <i>Repeat Viewings</i> as a nineties-era refashioning of Bostrom’s skeptical worry. RV records the simulation argument with a camcorder and plays the tape over and over again until the video itself becomes damaged by the VCR. The acts of re-collection, re-membering, and re-vision are themselves caustic, slowly corroding what they attempt to preserve. In Ashwood’s animation, the anxiety underlying Bostrom’s simulation argument deteriorates and falls away. The characters’ existential angst lies not in the fact that they live in a simulated reality, but rather in a general question of nostalgia: Is it worth satisfying? Is our wistful affection for the past an act of violence that we should avoid? Or are the lines of static that gradually obfuscate our favorite videos like green lines of code, shimmering with the promise of meaning?</p>",

		"slug" : "2012-12-21-translation-and-robert-musil",
		"body" : "<p>The translator’s preface is a curious genre.  I learned this as I studied it this fall for a translation project of my own, a translation of Austrian modernist Robert Musil’s novella <i>Die Vollendung der Liebe</i>.  Although the translator’s preface is not as well-recognized as the sonnet or the sestina, it has a fixed form.  First, the translator introduces the life of the author, often writing paeans to the author’s brilliance—which in reality justifies the <i>translator’s</i> present work.  With this bit of sorcery, the translation borrows the radiance of the original work, like a moon reflecting a sun without producing any light of its own, and the translator’s preface can avoid the real question: what necessitates the translation itself, as an original work?  The next part of the preface shows how the translator tried her best to polish the translation into a perfect mirror reflecting back all the light of the original; but because of the laws of optics, some of the light incident upon that mirror, inevitably, was lost.  The translator can then, in the final section, declare the discovery of a fourth law of thermodynamics: translation is failure, an irreversible process that loses a little bit of the original’s energy in every word of the new work.  And so, ultimately, what began as a justification becomes an apology for the very existence of translation.</p><p>But why not begin with this law of translation as failure as a premise, and build up a commentary from there, instead of deducing the same old law from new evidence?  In this process, it might be possible to justify a new work of translation with appeals to its internal logic and necessity rather than only those of the original.</p><p><span id=\"more-442\"></span></p><p>So, let me start with the axiom: all translation is failure.  That is, all translation is a failure to perfectly transmit all of the qualities of the original.  With that in mind, what justifies a new translation?  Allow me to borrow a concept from Robert Musil’s <i>The Man Without Qualities</i>, his masterpiece.  In a famous chapter of this enormous work, Musil introduces the notion of “essayism” through Ulrich, the main character of the novel.  Borrowing largely from Nietzsche, Musil writes the following (in translation, of course, by Sophie Wilkins and Burton Pike):</p><p>The accepted translation of “essay” as “attempt” contains only vaguely the essential allusion to the literary model, for an essay is not a provisional or incidental expression of a conviction capable of being elevated to a truth under more favorable conditions or of being exposed as an error…; an essay is rather the unique and unalterable form assumed by a man’s inner life in a decisive thought.</p><p>Musil’s definition of essayism refers to translation’s failure to fully capture the meaning of the word “essay.”  And yet, Musil does not rail against translation itself but rather against “accepted translation.”  The problem is not with translation’s failure to capture meaning but rather with the failure of a single, fixed translation to capture completely “the unique and unalterable form assumed by a man’s inner life in a decisive thought” in the original work.  In that sense, every new translation can be understood as this type of essay.  If no one translation can contain the “decisive thought” of the original, each one can serve as both an “attempt” and as a “decisive thought” in itself.</p><p>In the same chapter of <i>The Man Without Qualities</i>, Musil calls for an understanding of norms, ideals, and so-called truth “as a mobile equilibrium that at every moment requires continual efforts at renewal.”  Perhaps that is how we should understand the relationship between the “truth” of the original text and its versions in the target language.  Each of those versions is one of those one of those attempts, one of those “efforts at renewal” in our understanding of the original text.  And so translation gains an inner necessity of its own, one related to the original text but not necessarily contingent upon it.  There is no fixed, essential truth of the original text in the first place that a translation can aim to transmit.  There is only this “mobile equilibrium.”  In renewing our understanding of the original text, translations maintain this mobile equilibrium.  In other words, the “truth” of the original text requires the translations every bit as much as these require the original.</p><p>The imperfect act of translation itself can be seen, then, as an essay, an attempt—but the original question was how to justify a particular work of translation.  Ulrich, the main character of <i>The Man Without Qualities</i>, considers life “a vast experimental station for trying out the best ways of being a man and discovering new ones.”  Perhaps a translation can serve as one of these experiments for figuring out the best ways to render a text, a “decisive thought.”  Each of these experiments will have different parameters and different hypotheses about their results, and some of the experiments will be better conceived and achieved than others.  While translation may maintain and renew the truth of the original text, to justify any individual translation requires that the translator lay out the parameters of her experiment.  That way, it can be judged on its own inner light and not on light borrowed from the original text.</p><p>All translations are indeed failures.  But this failure is a matter of goals.  If the goal of translation is to create the perfect mirror of the original text, this failure is discouragingly absolute.  The laws of thermodynamics are universal; in any real process of translation, there will always be a loss of information.  The only text that contains all of the information of the original text, after all, is the original text.  But if instead the goal of translation is to make an essay, an attempt, an experiment, then failure is simply part of the goal. Some translations are certainly better and more successful than others.  But all translations can do their part in maintaining the “mobile equilibrium” of truth that Musil describes.  If a translation is not a successful experiment, it can at least be an interesting failure.</p><p class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\r\n<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\r\n\r\n</p>\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

His name was Publius Ovidius Naso. The year was 43 B.C. And the danger was two things: Love itself, and Ovid’s decision to write erotic poetry in a regime—headed by the cold and calculating Octavian—that prized chaste morality above all else.\r\n</p><p>Ovid and his brother were trained in oratory and rhetoric, skills fitting for their status: they were equestrians, the Roman equivalent of the knighted class. But Ovid felt his calling to the arts early on, and by eighteen he was doing his first recitations. His father disapproved of his son’s decision to devote his life to poetry (a relatable obstacle, as any aspiring authors out there will know), telling young Ovid that even the famous Homer of <i>Iliad </i>fame didn’t get rich off his writing (touché). Ovid listened dutifully, but as always has been the case, a true artist cannot refuse his calling, and soon he had succumbed to his poetic Muse.\r\n</p><p>Much of Ovid’s work draws strong parallels between love—often personified as <i>Amor</i>—and danger, pain, war, and destruction. To him, a lover was a soldier, subjected to all the same dangers that wartime might offer. <i>Militat omnis amans</i>, <i>et habet sua castra Cupido</i>, he writes in <i>Amores </i>I.IX: <i>all lovers serve as soldiers, and Cupid has his own camp</i>. And Ovid’s Cupid is a far cry from the chubby baby with tufted wings that graces Renaissance art. Cupid was a formidable enemy, a powerful god who had mastery over all: the very definition of danger. His power even trumped that of gods.\r\n</p><p>We are all familiar with the phrase o<i>mnia Amor vincit</i>—Love conquers all, coined at the end of Virgil’s <i>Eclogues</i>. Pause. When you think about it, this isn’t actually as romantic as it sounds. (Millions of teenagers who had these three words tattooed on their body start to panic.) Love is a <i>conquering </i>force. This same verb <i>vinco, vincere </i>is used in military histories to describe utter devastation of a land. <i>Veni, vidi, vici</i>; I came, I saw, I conquered. Love as a primal desire to conquer is present from the very birth of Eros, the Greek counterpart of Cupid. Later mythological accounts mark Cupid as the son of Venus and Mars, god of war, but his figure has primordial origins and  came before any of the other Hellenic gods or their Roman counterparts, as seen in this description from Aristophanes’ <i>Birds</i>:\r\n</p><p><i>At the beginning there was only Chaos, Night, Darkness , and the Abyss. Earth, the Air and Heaven had no existence. Firstly, black-winged Night laid a germ-less egg in the bosom of the infinite deeps of Darkness, and from this, after the revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful Love (Eros) with his glittering golden wings, swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest. </i>\r\n</p><p>Ovid’s Cupid is a vengeful deity, aware of his perceived inferiority and ready to attack anyone, god or man, who speaks ill of him. In the <i>Metamorphoses</i>, Apollo sees Cupid holding a bow, and patronizingly asks Cupid why he is playing with a man’s weapons, to which Cupid replies:\r\n</p><p><i>“Figat tuus omnia, Phoebe, te meus arcus; quantoque animalia cedunt cuncta deo, tanto minor est tua gloria nostra.'”</i>\r\n</p><p>“Let your bow pierce everything, Apollo, but let my bow pierce you: by as much as all living things yield to God, by that much is your glory lesser than mine.”\r\n</p><p>Ovid envisions Cupid in a vast victory triumph, carried in a golden cart drawn by doves and flanked by his comrades Error (Mistake), Furor (Anger) and Blanditiae (Flattery); behind him follow rows and rows of captive men and women, bound in chains, enslaved into his service. As he begs Cupid to spare him, as he has no lover, Ovid himself is shot, and his epic poetry—his early <i>Metamorphoses</i>, written in dactylic hexameter—loses a metrical foot, becoming elegiac couplets, the meter of love elegy. <i>Uror, et vacuo pectore regnat Amor</i>, he writes. <i>I burn, and Love reigns in my empty heart.</i>\r\n</p><p><i><br></i>\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">❖\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br>\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>She knows too the error that misled me, when I was ruined, </i>\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>that there was guilt, but not wickedness, in my actions.</i>\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Surely she’s good to me now because she harmed me before, </i>\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>when she was charged, with me, for a mutual crime.</i>\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Since they were once destined to be dangerous, </i>\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>I might wish I’d never touched the Pierian rites.</i>\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>But what can I do, now?

Few friends showed up to say goodbye to him, fearful that by visiting Ovid they too would incur the wrath of Augustus. He paid the price for his <i>carmen et error</i>, his poem and his mistake, all that he ever writes of the reason for his exile to Tomis, a dismal outpost on the Black Sea. The poem was likely his racy <i>Ars Amatoria</i>, The Art of Loving, which directly went against Augustus’s call for moral reform after the debauchery of the late Republic and was banned from all three of Rome’s public libraries. The mistake? Perhaps a scandalous affair or more likely general lèse-majesté, in line with Ovid’s character: playful, almost to the point of subversion. He was never tried for any crime; his exile was ordered by Augustus himself in a direct imperial edict. For Ovid, the choice to continue to produce poetry under such a regime as Augustus’s was as dangerous as he imagined his poetic subject to be.\r\n</p><p>Life in Tomis was a living death for Ovid. On the shores of the Black Sea, he had no audience; no one spoke Latin so far from Rome. He had no friends and no family. The luxuries of urban life were a distant memory. He was forced to abandon works he had spent years on, as he no longer could do the necessary research. He spent years dreaming of home, writing letters to his wife and friends of his desolation and sorrow. In exile, Ovid composed his <i>Tristia</i>, Sadnesses, and <i>Epistulae Ex Ponto</i>, Letters from the Black Sea, in which he begged Augustus to forgive him and let him return to his native city.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">Augustus, cold-hearted as he had always been, never relented.\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">Ovid died alone in Tomis after seven long and lonely years.\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">His grave was never found.\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br>\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">❖\r\n</p><p><br> Few depictions of the Emperor Augustus survive today. The most famous is displayed in the Vatican: Augustus, set in creamy marble, cheekbones sharp in his austere face, holds up his left hand, about to begin a rhetorical command. At his feet is Cupid, gazing upwards as if in admiration at Rome’s great conquerer. And so the two dangers that brought Ovid to power and tore him down found in each other a common ancestry; for legend has it that Augustus, like Cupid, descended from Venus herself.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p>By Francesca Violoch ‘18\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">FOUR\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br>\r\n</p><p>i.\r\n</p><p>submerged nausea that forgets your tongue,\r\n</p><p>coming back paired and folded, cat to\r\n</p><p>camel or sigma and coors.\r\n</p><p>                                                only scanning the left side and the same\r\n</p><p>                                                number of ribs, in the lower right-hand,\r\n</p><p>                                                like beige and tearing.\r\n</p><p>                        cupped above two red xs and a diagram\r\n</p><p>                        of hatched squares, to waste of\r\n</p><p>                        gritty piercing bowls.\r\n</p><p><i>a remarkable journey out of the office </i>on\r\n</p><p>cube platform of unzipped graphics,\r\n</p><p>on pixelating aphrodisiacs—\r\n</p><p>ii.\r\n</p><p>left of stale, this virus becomes\r\n</p><p>communicative, gathering itself\r\n</p><p>into threads, piles interwoven—\r\n</p><p>still separate, across the room. next\r\n</p><p>to a copy of the brothers karamazov,\r\n</p><p>laid out, untied, i am getting rid of the\r\n</p><p>excess. three clips later, i am discovered\r\n</p><p>tearing into some imbued post-it notes of\r\n</p><p>leadership and uniform, no longer taut to\r\n</p><p>the charcoal that flips into cover, the\r\n</p><p>cover that pulls on the lobes, all with\r\n</p><p>brow bones stitched to my cheeks. if\r\n</p><p>the presumed aura of the virus\r\n</p><p>hugged the body, creased, as if\r\n</p><p>escalating toward that new neon\r\n</p><p>climax of feverish contact— tripped and\r\n</p><p>cut its own trails in downward motion—\r\n</p><p>if it had only blushed, feverishly open,\r\n</p><p>exposed and sullen at the waist, laterally—\r\n</p><p>i would have been made knit. i would have\r\n</p><p>been made manifest in this bold repentance,\r\n</p><p>stumbling over the binding with my thumb\r\n</p><p>pressed to a bed of cells who would shriek\r\n</p><p>beneath it. i would be the bleak, would be\r\n</p><p>the winter, and let it spread. left\r\n</p><p>shared, i never had three ghosts\r\n</p><p>anyway. february is no different—\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p>By Sarah Toomey ‘19\r\n</p>",

When you come to the wing of the museum where I have installed my work, you sheepishly pick up a program and hurry in. There is no one else here. They know this show is for you, and will be kind enough to leave you alone with it.<br></p><p><br></p>  <p>You pass into a great marble atrium. It is cool and grey and smells like wet rocks. Everyone you have ever known is facing you. They are not moving or even breathing, but they are looking at you. Your high school english teacher is looking at you kindly. Your sixth grade crush is looking at you kindly. The kid you babysat a couple times when you needed pocket money in college is looking at you kindly. </p><p><br></p>  <p>You duck behind a black curtain into a tiny dark room where a film plays. In the film, your first love is speaking, looking you right in the eye. \"I am sorry,\" they are saying, \"I am so sorry. I wish I could have been better. We were the real thing. I wish I would have been smarter and kinder and unafraid and had known how to better handle my feelings. You meant a lot to me.\" You put your hand to the wall, but there’s nothing to touch. You walk through the curtain on the other side of the room. Here is a glowing pink neon sign. The sign reads: \"From now on everyone you love will love you precisely as much as you love them.\" The pink brightness reflects off the pool of water set in the floor, and you realize that it is not a pool but a canal. There is a very small canoe waiting for you. You climb in, and the water carries you through a tunnel where speakers project your parents’ voices; they are telling each other how proud of you they are.</p><p><br></p>  <p>The canal dries up and your canoe comes to a gravely halt. The tunnel is wide and dark. An engine roars to life – ahead is a city bus, sitting and waiting, presumably for you. You board, wondering how I convinced the museum to let me have a real live bus in a gallery space. \"Welcome aboard,\" the driver says. You sit down. The other bus-goers, all of whom look vaguely familiar, smile warmly at you. They don't make small talk. They know you would rather sit in silence. But they are there if you would like to speak with them.  </p><p><br></p>  <p>The bus arrives in another large hall. “This is your stop,” an old woman in the seat across from you says gently. You pull the yellow cord and the bus stops, just for you. </p><p><br></p>  <p>The whole floor of the hall is covered with grass. Your childhood best friend is lying in the grass, watching clouds projected on the ceiling. At the end of the hall is a corridor. On the walls, the faces of your past lovers are projected. They are speaking amicably to one another. They are all agreeing that you have affected each and every one of them in some distinct but significant way. </p><p><br></p>  <p>At the end of the hall is a large wooden door. You open it. The room is several hundred feet tall, and in it stands the person you love most in the world. They are enormous, filling the entire room, and you stand only at the height of their pinky toe. A ladder hangs in the space between their feet and stretches indefinitely upwards. There is no door in the room, and so you start climbing. You climb, and you continue to climb, and you start to wonder about the museum’s safety regulations. They should at least have guards to call the paramedics if you should fall. There are no guards, and the ladder is rickety and unstable. You climb past their chest, and then their shoulder, their chin. The ladder trails in through their closed mouth, presumably hooked over a tooth. Their lips are latched together. You unhinge them, and the jaw snaps open. You climb into the cavern-sized mouth and crawl across their tongue, using molars as handholds. You slither backwards and your lover swallows, digesting you whole. You take a bath in stomach acid. The fizz rocks your nerves to sleep and you lie numb, rigid, and dreamless, drifting past the duodenum into the channels of the small intestine. You wash up in dripping pink tunnels, the kind that a truck-sized worm with a hundred-year lifespan might burrow in as his magnum opus. The walls are rough, damp, and fleshy, like the inside of a great lung. You round a corner and the tunnel stretches straight ahead. The vanishing point is a pinprick of light: an out? After an indeterminate amount of time it swells into not an exit but a television, flat-screen and twice your size. Your pupils are swollen from the dark, burning from the overdose of LEDs. Text scrolls across the screen. Exit through the large intestine, the screen says. Do not get absorbed by the epithelial cells of the small intestine. Do not become a nutrient. You walk past the television and into another, wider tunnel, which abruptly opens onto a sterile museum hallway. End of exhibit, a sign says. Ahead of you there is a gift shop.</p>",

So I have followed from afar the activities at Harvard.</p><p>\tWhat I have always noted is that Harvard leads from behind. It is never the initiator of progress or justice.

That is amply demonstrated by William Wright’s book which only came out in 2005: Harvard’s Secret Court: The Savage 1920 Purge of Campus Homosexuals, which describes the surveillance and prosecution in in-house “trials” of gay students. These “trials” often led to suicides. Has Harvard ever apologized? To use a vulgar gay expression: “Get real, bitch!” Harvard does not apologize because Harvard never does anything wrong. To quote the song of the communist German Democratic Republic: “Die Partei hat immer Recht.” The Party is always right. Harvard bears more similarities in its attitudes and methods to communist regimes than to anything else I have encountered. It cowers its dissidents with very sophisticated and effective threats. It discerns its opponents’ soft spots and pierces them with stilettos. And Harvard does not cease until it has won—or until history has revealed Harvard’s position as wrong-headed and antediluvian. Then Harvard pretends it never took that position. Just a misunderstanding. Tell that to the suicides of the ’20’s.</p><p>\tIn the fall of 1972, my junior year, Dunster House did not have a room for me. The malevolent secretary at Dunster gave me a room with five strangers in which there was no bed for me. I had a friend in Kirkland House, whom I knew through my work at the Loeb Drama Center. He said he had assembled a group of gays in two suites of rooms at Kirkland and that they had an extra bed. I would be most welcome.</p><p>\tSuddenly, for the first time at Harvard, I experienced happiness and hope. Dunster House and Kirkland House both consented to the move but I had to have it approved by some official in University Hall. I naively thought this was a formality, so one fall day I ascended the steps to that gray stone building and on the left saw the office of the person whose approval I needed. I entered smiling and saw a woman rather long in the tooth and with an unhappy, gnarled face. I was somewhat apprehensive but because I had been told this would be a “rubber stamp,” I was not terribly concerned. I explained to this woman that I wanted to change house and told her the circumstances. Dunster didn’t seem to have room for me, and a collection of my closest friends were living together in Kirkland and had invited me to join them. There was room for me at Kirkland, and both Dunster and Kirkland had consented.</p><p>\tThe ancient crone’s face became twisted with scarcely suppressed rage. Barely in control of herself, she asked sharply: “Who has asked you to join them?” I told her the names, which she carefully wrote down—from time to time asking the correct spelling. (Obviously the techniques learned in the trials of the 1920’s had been passed down. An unholy apostolic succession.) Then she blurted out: “We know what you people are trying to do and we will not allow it.”</p><p>\tI tried to explain that no one had objected to it and that it made sense given the limited boarding space at that time. She responded: “That is all irrelevant. We know what you people are trying to create and I will not allow it. Please leave my office at once.” Obviously I complied.</p><p>\tI was in utter shock. I felt the deepest humiliation I have ever felt. I told my friend in Kirkland and he was also shocked, indeed speechless. I decided to move off-campus and I did. Of course I had to pay the $500 per semester off-campus penalty fee and I did, every semester. By being off-campus I was automatically allocated to Dudley House, which was not a bad thing. Being responsible for so many graduate students, Dudley had a level of sophistication far greater than that of the other Houses. They helped me in numerous ways. Obviously, not on gay issues. The latter seldom come up in a “House” without bedrooms.</p><p>\tI had entered Harvard as a freshman in 1970. I had a Southern accent and people, very politely, thought I was stupid. I was not. I gained all A’s my first semester, my first year and for my entire time at Harvard. I was one of the junior twelve in Phi Beta Kappa. My thesis won the Bowdoin Prize. I am no dummy.</p><p>I would have had a summa but for the personal animosity and unfairness of Brooke Hopkins, that ersatz aristocrat then in the English department. He had given me a cum on my thesis; the other grader, a graduate student (and they usually are harsher), gave me a summa. Right before my oral exam, the winners of the Bowdoin Prize were announced. Harvard does not tell anyone this but in the humanities, the oral is the only thing that matters. I walked into an ambush. My examiners were my great friend and the great scholar Professor Herschel Baker and Brooke Hopkins. The latter was of course miffed because the Bowdon Prize exposed him as being horribly wrong about my thesis. I ended up with a magna. That is Harvard. When Harvard acts fairly, it is by pure chance, and Harvard treated me very unfairly. I will always wonder whether the fact that my thesis comparing the literary styles and methods of Byron and Petronius and touching on some gay themes influenced Hopkins. </p><p>With the support of Dudley House and Professor Walter Jackson Bate, I was awarded a Marshall Scholarship and graduated with high honors at Oxford in Literae Humaniores (the hardest course at Oxford: in a two-week period one must complete twenty exams on Latin and Greek literature, philosophy, logic and history). </p><p>\tDespite its pretensions to being a liberal institution, Harvard never was and still is not. It is quite simply a massive money-gathering machine. It pursues irrelevant chimeras, such as the admission of women to the truly irrelevant Final Clubs, purely as a diversion, and as a camouflage for its intention to wipe out the Final Clubs and buy their land—essential to Harvard’s reckless expansion. Harvard has never and will never do anything bold for human rights—it will not displease its generous donors, most of whom give to ensure that their little darlings gain admission. What Harvard does in the name of equality or human rights, is diversionary. It fills space in the Crimson and occupies reporters.</p><p>In the early 1970’s homosexuality was not “in” and tolerance not “PC.” Those of us who were gay knew Harvard would never be a support and would almost certainly be our persecutor. Hence we moved furtively and hid our nature—even from very close friends. My sophomore roommate in Dunster was gay but I only learned it at a Harvard reunion in the 1990’s. Each of us had constructed elaborate ruses and excuses for our nighttime absences—completely unaware we were each playing the same game.</p><p>I remember attending the first Harvard gay student group meeting in Claverly in 1970 or 1971, where we all came in the greatest secrecy. (The Crimson had very bravely put in a little announcement beforehand. I still have it.) This was the dreariest assemblage I have ever attended. It was a very small group, and all were in terror. Bizarrely we spoke in whispers. Anyone who has been in Claverly knows what a massive pile that building is and how thick the walls are. The meeting was a fiasco. Almost entirely political talk; no plans whatsoever to organize gatherings where Harvard gays could meet and socialize. When I suggested that, the group looked at me as if I were a unicorn. We left either alone or in groups of two, to avoid attracting any attention. We knew we could have adverse consequences, possibly even expulsion, if exposed.</p><p>As a consequence of this horrid environment of fear and danger, one saw some of the brightest minds in America meeting for sex in the men’s rooms of Lamont Library. I have no doubt that men who are now Nobel laureates had furtive sex in those filthy stalls.</p><p>The gay scene in Boston was hardly accessible to Harvard students. There was Sporters, a bar on Beacon Hill, that stayed open far past the hour the subway closed, and in those days gays tended to choose a partner (we called them “tricks”) just before a bar closed. There was also the Other Side, which many of us reached somehow and then somehow returned to Harvard—walking over rail yards and vacant streets. Once I met someone at the Other Side and he inflicted on my neck numerous hickeys. I took from him a scarf and wore it during my classes on that dreadful day, when I was terrified my tendencies would be revealed. In those times we lived in such fear and panic, I did not see the obvious: a woman could also have been the source of the marks. </p><p>\tThe students were outwardly almost to a man very homophobic—or scared—and the “gay thing” was never mentioned except in mockery and derision. The reason is not hard to find. Everyone at Harvard had been top of his class and was programmed for success. The family pressure must have been horrendous. Homosexuality was inconsistent with success at that time. Thus everyone tried to prove he was an avid heterosexual and what better way than to denigrate gays?</p><p>\tI remember several particularly humiliating experiences at the hand of fellow students, and one student and one incident in particular. One night my friend in Kirkland, Steve Lonsdale (a beautiful human being but sadly now dead) and his roommate who was a very talented artist, had a party in their rooms in Kirkland House. A jock I vaguely knew in Kirkland House (now it appears he is a highly respected physician), and his jock friends pulled the fire alarm lever. We all came down – the artist in a black silk brocade dressing gown—and they stood in the quad pointing and laughing at us. To any observer we were clearly a bunch of homosexuals having a clandestine party. Sometime later I saw that an exercise class was being offered at the Harvard gym. This malevolent jock turned out to be the instructor and made fun of me in front of the class. I never returned to the class and I have never forgiven this humiliation. </p><p>Curiously enough, though few clubbies were gay, one very seldom heard anti-gay remarks in the Final Clubs. I remember only one such remark—from a rather dim clubbie who had just forgotten to go to a final exam. (He was twice a sophomore.) But I heard a continuous stream of anti-gay bile in the dining halls of the Houses, particularly Dunster and Lowell. </p><p>Harvard was the most poisonous environment in which I have ever lived. I had been at prep school, and the Episcopal priest was later found to have molested numerous male students in my time at the school (not me). This only came out in the last twenty years and soon after these facts were exposed to the world the man died. But there was no persecution of gays at my prep school. The administration of St. Stephen’s Episcopal School in Austin would not have stood for it and certainly would not have organized or participated in it. Dr. Becker, the headmaster, was a very moral and tolerant man. He admitted African Americans when most Texans abhorred that. Dr. Becker was a leader in tolerance and fundamental justice for all human beings. Harvard has always been a very distant follower. There was no gay persecution and Dr. Becker would have personally dismissed any faculty member who attempted it. Texas is not the backwater Yankees think we are. Unlike Harvard, St. Stephen’s was not born in sin. See page 71 of Mr. Wright’s book: William Bradford “presided over the execution of a teenager” for the “crime” of buggery (what a quaint term as the main character in “The Boys in the Band” put it.).</p><p>My life at the very tolerant St. Stephen’s explains my utter shock during my first weeks at Harvard. I quickly perceived that this was not St. Stephen’s; this was a dangerous place, and in this environment of fear, I redoubled my academic efforts and won A’s in the hardest courses—mostly graduate courses in the humanities as well as organic and physical chemistry courses. I spent days in the labs—more than anyone else. I recently found the postcard from the chemistry professor giving me my grades: Lab: 100+, course A+. Perhaps unknowingly he violated Harvard’s protocols. There is no A+ at Harvard. But this is a strong indication of how I submerged myself.</p><p>Faulkner was at fault. In The Sound and the Fury, he elevated Harvard, for Southerners, to a status it does not deserve and never has. They sold Benjy’s field so Quentin could go to Harvard. I firmly believe I did not receive at Harvard the education I deserved – and for which which my father worked hard to pay for. Recently I have looked online at the chemistry curriculum at MIT, which had also accepted me. It is awesome. Logically structured and not haphazard like so much at Harvard. Harvard is at times all tissue paper and paper mache. A Potemkin village. There is no wizard. Too much teaching was done by graduate students. There were a few—a very few—great professors (Bate, Baker, Clausen, etc. in the humanities; Watson, Ball and von Eggers Döring in science are just a few examples), but the average level did not impress me. (I think MIT was so occupied with their academics and research, they gave no though to whether a person was gay. I may be wrong. But the MIT of today is clearly not Nirvana—their behavior in the case of Aaron Swartz is reprehensible.) </p><p>\tIt is hard for people today to understand that in the 1970’s there was no support system at Harvard for gays. There was no place to run. The Advocate, the Signet Society and the Loeb Drama Center were unique in their toleration. They provided safe havens where no questions were asked and where an anti-gay statement or joke would have been as out of order and condemned as much as a statement of anti-semitism. From my only visit to the Lampoon (as an applicant), I quickly saw this was a different environment. More like the Houses. I may have been wrong about them, but I withdrew my application that very night. What will surprise most readers most is that the Final Clubs, with one notable exception (not the Porcellian, but the Club that from time to time flew the Nazi flag before its house), were almost all tolerant—but again in a very quiet way. But other than The Advocate, the Signet Society, the Loeb Drama Center, and to some extent the Clubs, there were no other havens. Once can say with truth, the more influence Harvard had over a place or group, the less tolerant it was likely to be. But this was Harvard, and Harvard hated homosexuality. Harvard’s influence on groups and daily life cannot be overemphasized. Harvard set the tenor, and in fear almost every undergraduate complied with, and even participated in, the intolerance.</p><p>\tWhen I say haven, I mean neutrality and the absence of anti-gay slurs. I never witnessed any flirting (except at the Loeb) or sexual advances (again, except at the Loeb).</p><p>An incident that will show my naivite occurred in my first year. I was desperately searching for a haven and a way to meet like-minded friends. There was an ad in the Crimson asking for volunteers to work on Leonard Lehrman’s production of Bertold Brecht’s The Days of the Commune. This play dealt with the communist commune that arose in Paris in 1871 after France’s defeat by Germany. It was a short-lived event but was of historical importance as the first Marxist state. It is a long and lugubrious play. I applied and was accepted and worked closely with Leonard in translating the work and in coordinating the cast. I think we had 60 cast members. Leonard was a very talented musician—and already then recognized as such—and I felt honored to be allowed to work with him. One night (it happened to be my birthday) as we were working on the text, Leonard said, “I’ve heard you are homosexual.” I turned white as a sheet and vigorously denied it. Only later did I learn that homosexuality is inconsistent with Marxist theory. I finished the play but had nothing more to do with this group.</p><p>\tI graduated in the spring of 1974 with more honors and prizes and citations than possibly any other student. I did not attend graduation, and I learned it created an embarrassment to Dudley House (which I regret) and the College (which I most certainly do not regret) when my name would be called and no one appeared. My friend Peter Gomes had invited me to his very exclusive graduation party. When I was a no-show, he never spoke to me again. I was very close to Peter. We drove together to Plymouth to visit his lovely, genteel mother. But even Peter lived in morbid fear.</p><p>I left Harvard the day after my last exam. I flew back to Austin, to the joys of the local bar scene and of Hippy Hollow on Lake Travis, where the gays would lie nude on the limestone boulders and swim in the crystal clear water. I felt like I had been released from a dark hell into the bright sunshine of life.</p><p>A few weeks later I received my Harvard diploma in the mail and immediately threw it in the trash.</p><p><br></p><p>POSTSCRIPT: </p><p>Only later did I learn how hard my father, also a lawyer, had worked to put me through Harvard. Harvard had infected me with an arrogance that caused me to ignore the cost. I had no scholarship. I paid full fare.</p><p>So this piece is dedicated to my father, Jack Dixon Welch II, a man who made massive sacrifices for me which I did not acknowledge at the time and who never tolerated intolerance in any form. </p>",

We begin with a scene from Tadpole’s starving childhood in China’s 1960s famine, so hungry he and his classmates fall upon a shipment of coal and start eating its shiny black rocks. Young Tadpole is remarkably mostly for his relationship to the township’s shining hero: his Gugu (“Aunt”), their township’s first modern obstetrician, deliverer of a thousand babies with barely a hitch. Tadpole grows up, begins a promising career in the PLA, marries his irrepressible sweetheart Renmei—as, with a change in Communist Party policy, Gugu’s role shifts from angelic savior to hardline enforcer of family planning. She starts implanting IUDs and mandating vasectomies across Gaomi, but it’s not until women begin to resist that the nightmare of this book takes off. A bloody campaign of forced abortions—pursued in the name of public health, resisted with subterfuge and farcical bluster and desperate escape attempts—sweeps across the town, destroying fetuses and women alike, till everyone left standing is both mourning and complicit. By <i>Frog</i>’s end, in modern-city China, Gugu and Tadpole are each living prosperously, each seeking penance in their way, each willfully blind to how their comfort rests on continued violation of the female flesh.</p><p><br></p><p><span></span>Mo Yan, like Faulkner, jabs the knife of black comedy to devastating effect. With <i>Frog</i>, he turns a hallucinatorily vivid eye on the violation of the body and the perpetuation of intergenerational trauma from the uncomfortable vantage point of the accomplice: he interrogates dogma, and complicity, and the self-serving lie, till no reader can plead innocent.</p><p><br></p><p>~        Edith Enright ‘18</p>",

Russian has a single adverb that encompasses the notion of consuming something's entirety with a single gulp.

I move over there. It's not. I need six hours a day to pick up a measly twenty-four pounds of grass. If it's good, I can move faster. I am limited: I do not have sharp teeth like a horse. I have to wrap my tongue around a bite and rip it out from its roots. This takes a long time. And then I need to chew the cud for eight more hours. </p>    <p>In reality \"Summer Reading\"  has always been a shiny plastic capsule for a bitter pill. The narratives conflict: reading is for fun/reading is for filling up the brain with writing-fodder for the year/reading is for affirming my self-image as one who likes reading.  I have successfully perpetuated the personal delusion that summer is the time for Personal Intellectual Development; for Good Habits like reading for thirty minutes before bed and enjoying it. During the year I do most of my reading gritting my teeth through PDFs: obviously I actually like to read when the pressure's off, when I can do it of my own volition in sunny cafés with a drink? I am a budding young member of the literati! </p>    <p>Another drink? Okay. I am 213 out of 218 pages into Ishmael Reed's <i>Mumbo Jumbo</i> and knocking out those last five pages seems to require ripping out all five fingernails on my right hand. The nails on my left hand went to Baudrillard in exchange for <i>Simulacra and Simulation</i>; left foot to Renata Adler for <i>Speedboat</i>. Burroughs wasn't satisfied with nails so I ripped out a chunk of my hair and now you're not allowed to look at the back left of my head for a few months. Anne Carson is kind, though. She accepts a couple eyebrow hairs. </p>    <p>When you see me in the fall I will have bits of paperback covers protecting the flesh tips of my fingers and threads from old hardcover bindings for hair. Whole pages will be grafted on where skin used to be. If I do decide to read<i> Infinite Jest</i>, my left big toe will have been replaced with the pages containing its footnotes rolled up into a tube and folded over. I will be more literary, though.</p><p><br></p><p>Lily Scherlis '16</p>",

		"title" : "Summer Reads: The Known World by Edward P Jones",
		"slug" : "summer-reading-6",
		"body" : "<p>Several members of my maternal family have settled on a single, dirt road in Wallace, South Carolina— a rural township about forty-five minutes from Charlotte.  My great-grandmother ‘s lot stands right at the turnoff from the interstate. If you start there and walk in a straight line, you’ll come across my aunt’s expansive yard, my cousins’ house propped up on wooden slats, and, at the edge of a forest, you’ll end up where we bury our dead, a clearing thick with yarrow weeds and marble. This narrow road, and the little world that radiates from it, extends for about a mile.</p>    <p>Edward P. Jones’s <i>The Known World (2000)</i> is firmly rooted in a similar space, where geography—physical, political, and social—conspires to shape the lives and relationships of its occupants. A work of historical fiction,<i> The Known World </i>is set on and around a Black owned plantation in the fictional Manchester County, Virginia. The plantation disintegrates into disorder after the death of its patriarch Henry Townsend, a former enslaved person and a fervent devotee to slavery’s machinery. </p>    <p>Although set at one of the most dramatic times in American history, amidst rumblings of slave uprisings and fevered speculations about the coming war, the novel dirties itself with the more intimate affairs of the plantation itself: the daily routines, social customs, and laws that govern its managers and the enslaved characters charged with its maintenance. Rooting the novel in this enclosed domestic setting is appropriate, as Jones’s narrative asks the reader to consider how every character—each trapped in varying social positions because of their color, economic class, and occupation—relates to one another in terms of family. What are the implications of claiming to own and to love what belongs to you in the eyes of the law? What does your personal Whiteness mean if you give life and wealth to your Black children? This summer, like most other summers when people die because we can’t figure out how their personal narratives intersect with our own, <i>The Known World </i>provides an urgent space for its readers to question what’s assumed to be true about their many heritages and identities. </p>    <p>What’s most remarkable is how Jones demonstrates the stubborn persistence of the past. For Jones’s narrator—omniscient and academic-- there is no meaningful border between the past and what follows. In one sentence, for instance, you’ll read about an enslaved character’s small quest to fill a pail of blueberries for the plantation’s children, and in the next, you’ll read census data that chart how that same enslaved character’s descendants make lives for themselves in the violent wake of slavery. The past bleeds into, and colors, the present. And in a country where we often confront our problems ahistorically, the novel’s insistence that the past lingers and holds power is an important declaration.</p>    <p>When you are slave descendent, you often imagine your family’s history as a straight, snubbed line, a dirt road that only extends so far. Most of us can name our parents and our grandparents. If you’re lucky like I am, you can push further and conjure faint impressions of your great-grandmother or great-grandfather. You might know that your great-grandmother swept her porch with the same broom she jumped at her wedding.  If you attempt to go any farther than that, though, you start to drift into the realm of conjecture and rumor, into old family stories with no clear beginnings or resolutions. Great Uncle Rufus, or was it Frazier, hopped freight up to New Jersey and was either married or killed in his first winter. Your grandfather’s grandmother worked a crop lien somewhere in Aiken or Darlington County, and died without any land in her possession. <i>The Known World</i>, for Black readers in particular, reminds us, forcefully, that our forerunners lived full, complicated lives that extended beyond the half-complete sketches and worn out anecdotes that our families cling to for meaning. </p>    <p>Popular slave narratives often center themselves on a litany of violent abuses. Nameless enslaved characters are whipped, shot, hanged, kidnapped, drowned, scalded with oil, sexually abused, tortured, torn in two, and constrained with ropes and chains. While Jones’s novel does not sidestep or avoid the incomprehensible amount of violence in the lives of its enslaved characters, it refuses to let that violence supersede the tremendous complexity of their living: their tilling, their sewing, their laughing, their doll-making, their crying, their painting, their romances, and their games. If you need images and stories of full-hearted, Black living to rebel against this summer’s parade of Black death, <i>The Known World </i>is a vital piece of art. </p><p><br></p>    <p>Miles Counts ‘18</p>",

		"body" : "<p>It was raining when Rachel learned she would never become pregnant. She preferred to look at\r\nthe rain instead of the fluorescent light of the doctor’s office, the syringes, the biohazard signs,\r\nletting the doctor’s monotone and the grind of water pellets hitting the window become white\r\nnoise. Her mom was in the corner. Her eyes said “Sorry, honey,” but her lips were pursed,\r\nsilently saying “Shit. Shit. Shit.”!\r\n</p><p>Physically, nothing had changed. Rachel could not carry a child because she was a child\r\nherself. But she had wanted to have a child, eventually, in the abstract, like how a kindergartner\r\nwants to be an astronaut. She smiled in spite of herself when toddlers stumbled by and picked\r\nout her favorite names names like Tessa and Grace that she would save for future reference.\r\nShe knew that soon she would get older, and she would lengthen while her hips widened, and\r\nthen she would get older, and she would find herself cutting the crust off sandwiches, driving\r\nother, smaller bodies to soccer practice or gymnastics or violin, and then she would get older,\r\nand her body would be folding into itself, barren again. She just skipped a few steps, that’s all.</p><p>\r\nIt's the things we don’t plan for that kill us, she heard someone say, once. Except that this\r\nwould not kill her, the doctor said. “It’s only a parasite. The only things she has to worry about\r\nare a few stomachaches after a large meal. It doesn’t harm the body in any way, it just keeps\r\nher from having enough nutrients to ovulate,” The doctor is the kind of person who gets nervous\r\nwhen he talks to children so he talks like a textbook and won’t look Rachel in the eye. Her\r\nmother asked if there was anything they could do. The doctor shook his head and coughed off a\r\ngrimace. “It won’t die until she does.”<br><br>\r\nOn the way to the doctor’s office they talked about her birthday. It wasn’t for a few days but her\r\nmother had brought home the cake that morning, still enclosed in its white cardboard box. She\r\nwondered if she would feel older. Now the way home was long and silent, but for the rain and\r\nher mother’s occasional sighs. Rachel found herself looking at the creases folding around her\r\nmother’s face. It made her look like she was holding something back, like the wrinkles around\r\nher lips were keeping her from speaking. Rachel held her abdomen lightly, with one hand.<br></p><p>When she got home she went straight to the bathroom. Her mother didn’t stop her. She looked\r\nat her stomach in the mirror for a while. She thought it might have gotten bigger, but it was hard\r\nto tell; her stomach was only slightly bloated, like the curve of an almond. Perhaps this is how\r\nher mom felt when she was pregnant with Rachel. Perhaps it was not that she would never\r\nbecome pregnant, it was that she would be pregnant forever, but with an insect, a worm, an eel.\r\nShe thought about her birthday. People would ask her if she felt older. The cake was in the\r\nrefrigerator, chocolate with pink frosting. She sat in the darkness of an empty kitchen and ate it\r\nwith a spoon. </p>",

		"slug" : "Archives_cultural_radical",
		"body" : "<p>Richard Rosen’s “Metaphors of a Cultural Radical,” from the December 1969 issue of the <i>Harvard </i>Advocate, seethes with a brand of rage that feels both relevant and naïve, alternately violently precise and hopelessly scattered. Rosen, a twenty year-old sophomore, was terrified by the institutional violence he witnessed first-hand in the preceding two years, both in his native Chicago at the 1968 Democratic National Convention and at Harvard during the spring 1969 student strike. Rosen, who worked with Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell during his time as an undergraduate, has gone on to write a number of humor books, histories, and sports articles. In reading his revolutionary words—he curses corporate culture and aesthetics, sees President Pusey’s face superimposed on that of every chauvinistic cop-pig, and dreams of a world in which cultural appreciation, rather than the profit motive, might finally win out. </p><p>What can the Younger Generation glean from Rosen’s words today, in the midst of a national reckoning that only appears to getting more surreal by the hour? Have we become too cynical and careful to appreciate the confrontational tone of his complaints? Do his breakdowns of racial politics appear too appropriative given our contemporary understanding of spiritual theft across ethnic lines? Does the relative formlessness of his text reflect what has been retrospectively deemed a hopelessly privileged non-revolution? Does social media make it difficult to effectively criticize individual peers who may be living lives that we find abhorrent? Or are we all reduced to such a confusing ideological morass that we aren’t even confident enough in our own opinions to judge those who we theoretically loathe?   </p><p>At the end of the criminally under-discussed 2015 EDM film <i>We Are Your Friends, </i>Zac Efron’s DJ character lets out a bellow to a mesmerized Summer Fest crowd: “Are we ever going to be better than this?” Is our cultural equivalent to Rosen, then, going to some version of an Internet-art sprite, hopelessly infused with the arguably fascist trappings of corporate music festivals and digital daze? </p><p><wbr></p><p>Here, presented for the first time online, is the full, 4,000-word glory of R.D. Rosen’s polemic against establishment America.</p><p>~ David Kurlander </p><p><br></p><p><strong>In </strong>which the author intends to show that the Revolution is not a war of rhetoric, but a festival, with music in the background; having not even tried to synthesize the thousands of pages he has digested concerning the Revolution, young radicals, and the younger generation. Instead of attempting a conscientious analysis of radical politics, habits, or psychology, he simply remembers certain things as they happened or were thought of and the catchy phrases he jotted down with which to describe them. </p>  <p>Also, in which the author has licentiously used, but forgone the definitions of, many terms, reasoning along with the venerable S.I. Hayakawa that words often have little relation to reality. The only realities that matter here are the tastes of war, racism, poverty, tear gas, and your vision of a better world. </p>  <p>The terms: </p>  <p><i>Military-Industrial Complex </i></p>  <p><i>Neighborhood Theatres </i></p>  <p><i>Older Generation </i></p>  <p><i>Participatory Democracy </i></p>  <p><i>Politics </i></p>  <p><i>Power Elite </i></p>  <p><i>Revolution </i></p>  <p><i>System </i></p>  <p><i>Technocracy </i></p><p><i><br></i></p>  <p><strong>I</strong></p>  <p><strong>There</strong> is one thing we are learning to accept: For so long the recipients of the blessings of an older generation, we are now the recipients of an uncertain wrath. After nineteen, twenty, twenty-one years of precious non-conformity, after an adolescence full of insolence, you and I are paying for it. That sense of humor and charmingly cynical attitude toward our culture that our parents praised us for, that vision of a less turquoise, more individualized society that teachers rewarded us for, are now incurring their hate. The uneasiness we felt at high school dances and our disapproval of Howard Johnson’s did not really disturb our parents; sometimes, they even applauded our discontent. Sneering at politics we were only beginning to understand and hypocrisy they were sure we would learn to rationalize, our disgust was considered youthful arrogance and our grades were considered above average. But now that our disdain for certain scabs and sores has grown into a denunciation of a society we see as irrevocably ill, we are suddenly dangerous and “destructive.” Armed with the same complaints as always, we are no longer loved. In fact, we are even beaten and gassed by an older order strangely afraid of our virility. </p><p><br></p>  <p><strong>II</strong></p>  <p><strong></strong>“I once saw a man he danced with his wife…” </p>    <p><i>“Do the Tighten Up…</i></p>  <p><i>To your left </i></p>  <p><i>And to your right </i></p>  <p><i>Everybody can do it</i></p>  <p><i>But don’t you get too tight.” </i></p>  <p><i></i>Archie Bell and The Drells</p>  <p><i>But say, bards, you keep off our bridges.

Four days later, we forced the system to strip itself. The subliminal repression it had always used successfully to insure its operation was inadequate in the face of a mass demonstration. Its absorbent power, its “repressive tolerance” broke down. When pressed for real answers about the war and racism, the only response was police force and its attendant violence. Perhaps, at first, we looked upon the riots as an aberration of law enforcement, too reminiscent of our impressions of the recent Prague invasion to be wholly American, surely, this wouldn’t happen again. Yet, far from being a case in which the clash of an uncommonly large crowd of demonstrators and an irresistible police force created an unreasonable amount of violence, it was a preview of a coming attraction which would make its way to neighborhood theatres in Berkeley, Madison, and Cambridge. </p>  <p>And when the system stripped for us, what we saw was not a beneficent protective body. The figure, although indisputably male, had soft sagging breasts and wherever he went, twenty cops escorted him. </p>  <p>For many, the fight first came alive in Chicago and it was not difficult to tell the sides: We wore just about any uniform and they were mostly in shades of blue and business suits. August 28<sup>th</sup>…I am down on my knees on Balbo Street. Gas in my lungs and eyes and mouth. When I fight for vision, I am facing stopped traffic and a mother perched behind the oversized steering wheel of a Camaro. I feel like a fool, on my knees. But I see others gasping and stumbling. I am asked if everything is okay. I ask one girl if I can help. No, she says, no one, nothing can help. I run to a fountain across from the Sheraton-Blackstone and dip my flaming head into the water. I have chosen sides. </p>  <p>August 1968 was our introduction to higher politics, our tour of the military-industrial complex that we had heard so much about from people like L. Mendel Rivers. We did not come to Chicago so much because we had specific plans in mind, but because we sensed something was going to collapse, somehow our worst suspicions about the country were going to be confirmed. </p>  <p>On Saturday, the 24<sup>th</sup>, Lincoln Park was filling with hips, yips, and others who hadn’t decided on a name. An old man, a newspaper wedged between his arm and his side, walked slowly among the figures, smiling, perhaps feeling some affinity for us as he strolled through the park. I was to imagine these seeming polar sympathies throughout the week. Old men minding their business were transformed into compatriots who felt as disenfranchised as we did. Crumpled dowagers on Michigan Avenue, by virtue of their loneliness, became radical sympathizers. Later, at Harvard, I even began to sympathize with a few cops as I looked in their faces; or rather I imagined that they were, deep within, on our side. In Chicago, newly indoctrinated into active radicalism, the cops were the menacing villains. Certainly, I saw behind the corrupt convention to a corrupt system and behind Chicago I discovered a dozen other cities that were going to fall, but I didn’t really see behind the cops. To me they were not just the agents of a power elite, but the members of it to. I couldn’t disassociate their jobs (busting our heads) from themselves as people (often victims of their employer, the state.) At Harvard, however, I was not afraid of them. In fact, I felt pity for them. Brought in by a university president to do a job, they had very little insight into the nature of the battle they were commissioned to fight. In many respects, they were being used to fight their own class interest. I only saw Pusey’s face beneath their helmets. When someone would yell to a cop, “Why are you doing this to us?’, he couldn’t answer. At one point, I wanted to take one cop aside to ask him how hard he had cried at his fathers’ funeral. I wanted to return to him some of the humanity he renounced every time he touched a student with his club. </p>  <p>       In reality, though, the Great Polarization had begun. Dowagers with their manic lipstick were not even impartial observers; they would send in congratulatory letters to Daley and Pusey, as if daughters had just been married. At Harvard, moderates, in their own frustrating way, supported the strike yet often obfuscated the issues. Professors whose courses endeared us turned against the politics their lectures had helped to develop. </p>  <p>“…but don’t put Vaseline on <i>after</i> you’ve been gassed,” the polo-shirted girl said to the marshals sitting on an embankment in the park. “Back injuries? Don’t touch the injured man…keep a wet towel in a Baggie, you can put it over your mouth if you get gassed or Maced.”</p>  <p>Inside the brick house at the top of an embankment, five or six old men played cards in the large barren anteroom. They huddled around a dank folding card table while a fan droned over the doorway. They had been playing there for years and they played on through the <i>washoi </i>maneuvers, the preparation, and the good vibrations in Lincoln Park, their dark rumpled sportscoats well defined against the cream and light grey wall. During this past summer, I passed by the brick house again, and they were playing for the weather was warm. </p>  <p>Spare dope? Spare change? Spare tire? We are in great need of many things. </p>    <p><strong>Late </strong>in the afternoon, a black family needed a short-center fielder and asked a white hip-yip to play in their softball game. Though I was wrong, at the time it looked like it might be the most important thing that happened all day. </p>  <p>            On Sunday night, the evening of the first large-scale police raid in the park, over three thousand milled on the grass, talking idly with reporters and mincing in front of photographers. “You can’t take pictures in this darkness without a flash, Howie,” a newsman said. </p>  <p>            At ten-fifty, some hippies raised a home-made Viet Cong flag amidst a clot of people on the edge of the park. A TV arc light hit them instantly at the cameras began to hum. By eleven forty-five, five thousand of us were in the streets. A small sweep by the cops started up North Avenue and turned down Wells. We started to run away, but a marshal cried quickly, “Walk slow! Walk slow!” I turned and walked slowly down Wells to my brother’s apartment and fell asleep. </p>  <p>            Earlier, on Sunday afternoon, the movement proved it could embrace almost anybody: High school girls, apostate liberals, wing-tipped clerks on their lunch break. “The pigs are disturbing my peace,” a boy who wore Vitalis complained to a group sitting cross-legged on the lawn. “When I buy marijuana, they stop me and that’s disturbing my peace, because grass is my peace. We should tie them down and force a reefer down their throats and then they’ll know what life is. Hey,” he said after a pause, “I want to write for you too. Listen, I can’t go home, cause that’s the Chicago State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. I put my trust in you guys. Really.” </p>    <p><strong>On</strong> Wednesday, August 28, at 2:30, the day of the proposed march to the impenetrable Amphitheatre, the gas hit me even before I crossed Clark Street on the North Side. The tear gas which had been used the night before still hung heavily in the air and as I stepped off the curb, my eyes began to tear and burn. I turned back. Across Clark, an elderly man was about to walk into the invisible field of vestigial gas. As he entered it, he suddenly started to rub his eyes vigorously, glancing about him. After a moment of bewildered posturing, he walked on. The next performance involved a woman who, as the gas hit her, spun around sharply as though she had been pinched on the ass. I tried to cross the street once again but couldn’t and retreated to the rarer atmosphere of the curb. I sat down next to two small black kids and pulled a cold plum out of a bag of fruit I was carrying and pressed it to my irritated eyelids. I sneezed violently. “Whatcha doing?” smiled one of the kids. “You putting plums on your eyes?” </p>  <p>            That afternoon, I met my first cop. After a long wait by Grant Park for the negotiations with the police officials to end and the march to the Amphitheatre to begin, my friends and I walked across the bridge to Michigan Avenue for some dinner. We walked up to the door of what turned out to be the Sheraton-Blackstone Hotel Coffee Shop. Inside, I could see black-aproned waitresses moving about tables peopled with delegates and businessmen. A fat, unctuous cop stood at the door. Ignoring him, I walked up to the revolving doors. The cop put his hand on my chest. </p>  <p>            “Where do you think you’re going, fella?” he intoned. </p>  <p>            “We want to go inside and eat,” I said, too afraid to be sarcastic. </p>  <p>            “Go away.” He drummed his stick in his hands. “Go on, get out of here. You’re all faggots anyway.” </p>  <p>            “Look,” I said, regaining courage. “All we want is some dinner.” </p>  <p>            He moved fully in front of me. “I said to get out of here, you faggots. Understand?” It was like a movie. “C’mon, you faggots.” Oddly, I wore relatively short hair, a Marshall Fields shirt and socks. “We got jails for guys like you.” As we moved away, I heard him laughing behind us. After that, the word ‘pig’ became part of my vocabulary. </p>  <p><strong>At</strong> a cocktail party Thursday afternoon in the Conrad Hilton, Senator George McGovern stood at a window overlooking Michigan Avenue. “Until last night,” he said, “I was inclined to dismiss police brutality as exaggerated. But last night, when I looked out this window, I realized the stories were true.” </p><p><br></p>  <p><i><em>As you know, I have had the reputation for not going out a great deal. My reaction to last night makes it clear that I must go out more often and be more involved…in what are obviously troubled times…What we saw was I’m afraid a very uptight establishment literally goading people…hitting people who had no reason to be hit…Last night, I saw so-called Law and Order, without any consideration for justice or democracy. That doesn’t separate us very far from totalitarian society.</em> </i></p>  <p><i>Hugh M. Hefner</i></p><p><i><br></i></p>  <p><strong>III</strong></p>  <p><strong>What</strong> we learned at Harvard is that it can happen and might happen anywhere—at a university, on your favorite street, to your best friend, at weddings and grand openings. Aside from the Great Discoveries we made about our school and its complicity not only with the war effort, but with the American way of somehow destroying all the good things this country is supposed to stand for, we discovered that nothing is really safe. There is no sanctuary. At Chicago, we were attending a demonstration; it was their turf. But Harvard was like watching a murder take place in your own home. There is hardly any place to hide from a government that will neither accept or even listen to criticism. </p>  <p>            I think of Matthew Arnold’s idea of criticism: “Simply to know the best that is known and thought in the world and, by in turn making this known, to create a new current of true and fresh ideas.” Obviously, the system is not without its critics. It is that the power elite in this country, attuned only to their own voices, will not listen to them. No new currents are created because people cannot reach their government. (The essence of participatory democracy is that certain people, recognizing the inefficiency of representative government, now want to directly control decisions that effect them by being their own representatives.) In traditional democratic theory, the will of the people is synonymous with the will of the state. Yet, there is a depressing homogeneity among politicians and the tendencies of their politics while the will of the people changes rapidly. Despite the fact that government offices are periodically vacated, one tends to regard Johnson and Nixon, Rusk and Rogers as the slightest modification of a grim theme. They touch history only in the sense that they are totally subservient to it; for them, events become unmanageable and the war becomes more important and more powerful than man’s power to stop it. So we are stuck with the same war year after year like a musical which, although it bombed in New Haven, persists in playing to an empty house. Really, none of us are even watching it, none of us will ever play a part. </p>  <p>            And while the government carries out its dubious functions, our new currents run beneath it, unattended. If our “new currents” were simply a stream of radical political thought and activity, the conflict between generations today could be easily characterized as a recurring political phenomenon. But, it is much more than that; our confrontation is more than a starkly political one which demands an end to the war, to racism, and other perversion of democracy. The revolution is much broader and deeper because it is confronting American Culture too. In their own respective historic contexts, radical political confrontations have always occurred. In the Twentieth Century alone, American democracy has been challenged from the left by Wobblies, the Communist Party, and assorted socialists. The present New Left is another episode in the history. Unlike the others, though, it will persevere, not on the strength of the <i>cultural </i>alternative the Movement offers. </p>  <p>            If we define culture as a society’s or nation’s “ways of life,” politics is one of those “ways.” Politics, just like other “ways” such as social norms and economic life, is performed within the context of the culture and assumes its character not only from the particular form of government it attempts to support, but from the way we eat our breakfast, act when we greet people on the street, and handle our personal budgets. The thrust of the Movement is not toward politics alone; the Movement has also emerged as a new way of dress, of conversation, of art, of life-style. We do not see politics as a disease—we see, in a much broader sense that our culture is a disease, a set of reprehensible ways of life, and politics is one of those symptoms. It is primarily a cultural revolution which feeds on a tradition and set of values more alien to the establishment than is our radical politics. The inexorable influence of the Beats, the Beatles, acid rock, Dr. Spock, being the first suburban sons and daughters, and the revival of a sense of the absurd in art are more foreign to the older generation than the radical politics which they once saw before in a different form. But our near-solipsistic, haughty view of culture recalls, if anything, only the Dadaists of the early Twentieth Century in Europe. Is not this following characterization of the Dadaist an apt description in many ways of how we treat the art we create and how we deal with an unsensitized world? : </p><p><br></p>  <p><i>Art is separate from life; the artist is independent of the world and superior to the lifelings…Once the artist had come to be regarded as a being set apart from the world of ordinary men, it followed that his aloofness would be increasingly emphasized…Art would come to be treated as a self-sustaining entity…No longer having to communicate with a public, it would become more opaque. It would be freed from elements extraneous to itself, and particularly from logic and meaning, statistics and exhortation. [The artist] would be proud, disdainful toward the family duties and the law of the tribe…</i></p>  <p><i></i>Malcolm Cowley, <i>Exiles Return </i></p><p><i><br></i></p>    <p><strong>Yet </strong>our Movement has added something still: Willfully divorced from the general public, it appeals nonetheless to a small but broad cross-section of Americans. If this cultural revolution is indeed sheltering artists as well as politicoes, gaining the sincere sympathy of some adults as well as prepubescent highschoolers, then it isn’t going to be killed by an end to the war or conciliatory political adjustments. It is not going to be killed by anti-riot legislation because the bulk of the protest is more subtle than open conflict. A growing disenchantment with this country among SDSers as well as Young Americans for Freedom, among a handful of senators and a small number of responsible administrators tells us that someday the present system is not going to make it anymore. </p>  <p>            This Movement transcends politics and will not die out, I pray, but will create a new culture in two or three generations. The Movement will have succeeded only when universities stop destroying the homes of working class families for their own aggrandizement, when high rises are no longer built in the country, when sea lions are not killed off the coast of California by oil companies, when girls can have sparkling smiles because they have sparkling smiles and not because they use McClean’s, when we stop lying to each other and stop listening to one another’s lies. If our government had not been able to lie to us about the true nature of democracy, they could not have perpetrated an obscene war despite our outcries. If they had found we would not succumb to lies about the war and its “imminent” success, the army could not have lied to the farmers in Idaho when they killed 6000 sheep testing lethal gases. If we had not for so long believed that personal freedoms were ours, the government would not have been able to pass off false freedoms as real ones. But we have not all learned, and many of us do believe now that the troops are coming home. </p>    <p><strong>If</strong> we consider the Rev as a cultural insurrection, then the more doctrinaire, intensely political factions like the Progressive Labor Party become a hindrance as their enforced policies of conformity in political line and dress and their disapproval of Black nationalism contradict the libertarianism of some factions of SDS and young cultural radicals everywhere. There are few things more impervious to revolution in this country than our political structure, because we are not in control of our political destiny at all. If we comprise our entire revolution of blunt demands for political power and change, our protests will only be met with a more than equivalent amount of violence and repression. But our culture is in our hands because we are part of it and by waging a cultural struggle by occupying buildings to save lives and music, we may encounter less resistance. </p>  <p>            What cultural radicals are revolting against, then, is clearly not a specific political institution. What we protest, after we have wept over the killings in Asia and in our own country, is the way of life that not only engenders Presidents like Johnson and Nixon, but creates the people who vote them into office. The conservatively-dressed man on the elevator riding up to his desk job for a business firm attracts our attention because the thought of an alternate conception of life has probably not occurred to him. His dress is a uniform for the technocracy, as if wearing three piece suits is an occupational imperative. We protest a society which exerts the subtle pressure to dress and act a certain way if you make your living a certain way and which condemns a man for wearing no clothes at all or for using a four-letter word when a more polite one would suffice. </p>    <p><strong>I am</strong> perplexed by the recurrent liberal accusation: “But you revolutionaries only want to destroy. You don’t have any programs or specific suggestions.” First, this presupposes that all young radicals are politically committed when even the most political radical thought is tinged by concern for social reform and a cultural reassessment of America. And you cannot destroy culture. Culture is the sum total of all our attitudes and norms, no matter what they are. And if the accusation is a valid political one, it still appears that the occupation of a university building does not precipitate destruction, but change. Haven’t the present condition of the blacks and the intransigence of administrators in the face of student petitions and peaceful demonstrations proved that change is no longer a question of verbal persuasion? Unfortunately, buildings must be occupied because it is now apparent that only an affirmation of physical strength succeeds in an ideological skirmish. A government which believes the key to world peace is half a million troops in Vietnam can only be expected to understand just that same principle of physical presence on domestic issues. The so-called peaceful channels have been tried, but even in those waters there are sharks. </p><p><br></p>    <p><strong>IV</strong></p>  <p><i>“To the left and to the right…”</i></p>  <p><strong>Where</strong> are we going? To begin with, we are going to learn how to live a little better. During the strike at Harvard, we learned that life and love are not always potential energies. Those who supported the strike as a political tactic, and even those who supported it because spring had invaded the Yard, learned how to make love to themselves, to each other, to their dreams, to their temporary freedom, to silk screens, to nurture and make love to the proposition that sometimes we get to pull our own triggers. </p>  <p>            Education in this country is a curious medium. It reveals to the student in its course the infinite possibility for creation and knowledge, but escorts him into a society which often defies us to aspire. More than ever, we are feeling our capacity for brilliance in many fields, but we increasingly realize how useless many of our talents will be in a world controlled by others. Many understand this paradox now. Others of us, seduced by our own creativity and particular vision, will see too late that we will not always be honored for our dreams and talents. At the same time they educate us, they inculcate us into a system which restricts our power to change with its power to repress. They give us knowledge, but deny us its real application; they get us hot, then they take away our women. </p>  <p>            Almost more than anything our estrangement from our university education draws us together. We find ourselves in great and dissatisfied numbers on many campuses. Yet there is paradox inherent in the Movement: Despite all the common bonds, we are not as much an alienated generation as a generation of alienated individuals. As such, each of us has his own solutions and his own ego trips. We are not so much a generation of coherent protestors as we are radicals easily mobilized by issues on which we take a common stand. At times, we are even alienated from each other. Certain factions have just as much difficulty reconciling themselves with fellow radicals as they do with the establishment to which they are opposed. Progressive Labor’s grim-faced revolution, for instance, sometimes frightens me as much as the Harvard administration. Both condemned the joy of music in Harvard Yard. </p>  <p>            October, 1969…two weeks ago, the Vietnam Moratorium came and went in Boston, under blue skies sprinkled with disappointing speeches. Despite its dimensions, the Moratorium often appeared devoid of crucial political power. Whereas before we were cutting niches in the left and right sides, the top and bottom of American politics, we had now momentarily converged in the soft center. Fortunately, recent movies and a growing, heartwarming “divisiveness,” among many other things, prove that our cultural imprint is deepening. SDS may die, but Jack Kerouac lives on. Don’t worry, we can make it happen. You can do it. I can do it. He can do it. Everybody can do it. Just don’t get too tight. </p>",

By \"it\" they mean the alleged proclivity of the deck to arrange itself in such an order as to portray what’s coming for us.

It was meaningful. It didn’t tell me the future but it gave me an occasion to consider what it might look like.

		"body" : "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. The revelation of a significant duality in the power of TV’s fictive constructions was a shocking component of this year’s political cycle. The televisual realm seamlessly deluded a mass population, assuring to its sheep the reality of an idyllic and pastoral fiction, while simultaneously transposing a didactically normative televisual fiction into the real through a reality TV star’s cult of personality. Even in the age of the Internet’s landless sprawl, the television sits slyly, still, on its quiet throne. One is now prompted with a necessity yet unseen in this new century to consider both the positive and negative implications to subscription or flight from the televisual system.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. For years now, I have harbored an addiction to cooking television, watching with rapt attention as scores of ‘cheftestants’ (<strong>© </strong>Bravo?) try their hands at organized competition, vying for their chance to prove themselves The Best before the eyes of the public, who are taught to adore the wild dances that grace the flickering screen. These shows, often a gateway drug into everything from foodie culture to reality TV, create a fictive model of competition that announces itself, bald-faced, as our Reality. I watch them while I eat my solitary meals, and my food tastes better. I watch them as I clean my room—the pressure of the clock ticking down to zero keeps my cheeks rosy and my spirits high, the cheers of the masses filling the silence. The sublimation of competitiveness into everyday realities clearly knows no bounds. Often, I gaze into the screen, unwittingly assuring myself that I am gaze-worthy, too. I play, I run—I am an athlete. My max bench press continues to drop precipitously, but I <i>compete</i>. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Reference to my own athletic fictions aside, I must wonder about the healthfulness of embracing this instinct. Does any engagement in televisual systems feed into an inherently sinister power to Trump the real? Or can investment in the power of television reflect faith in constructive ends? Is the harmfulness of Fame and Culture a postulate of televisual media’s existence, or is there an inverse to be explored? I plan to probe the issue thoroughly—so I stay tuned, to find out. </p>",

		"body" : "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Three nights ago, I was sitting at the corner table of my high school friend’s yellow-lit kitchen –– he was the high school friend whose house always served as the default place to hang, a default we default to even four years out of high school –– playing Hearts. In the background of our card game, as each of us tried and failed to “shoot the moon,” a tinny cellphone speaker squeaked out the most persistent & divisive Christmas song of all time. The song in question is, of course, “Last Christmas,” by the 80’s music duo <em>Wham!</em>, one half of whom is George Michael, namesake to Michael Cera’s character in <em>Arrested Development</em> and the most recent in a line of beloved figures to have passed away during 2016.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Last Christmas” is one of those seasonal songs on which everyone seems to have an opinion, no one of which is exactly the same. Some people are cynics, who hate “Last Christmas” with a rage that seems to outsize the song itself –– this group counts Default-House and <em>The Awl</em>’s <a href=\"https://theawl.com/wham-s-last-christmas-is-the-most-horrible-holiday-song-ever-made-5f7abbab8e54#.ruai1xjkb\"><u>Tom Keiser</u></a>, author of “Wham!’s ‘Last Christmas’ is the most horrible holiday song ever made,” among its membership. Cynic-adjacent are the Christmas crusaders, who point out, as makers of the Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/whamnotxmas/?ref=page_internal\"><u>group</u></a> “Wham's ‘Last Christmas’ IS NOT A CHRISTMAS SONG!” did, that “Last Christmas” is pretty secular. Its tension comes from heartbreak rather than holiday (consider the chorus: “Last Christmas, I gave you my heart / But the very next day, you gave it away / This year, to save me from tears / I'll give it to someone special”), and has about as much to do with Baby Jesus as any other top forty favorite. There are the loyalists, like  <a href=\"http://www.bandt.com.au/media/radio-dj-causes-rage-by-only-playing-whams-last-christmas\">Austrian DJ</a> J<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">oe Kohlhofer</span> who took heat last year for locking himself in his radio station and playing the song twenty-four times on repeat. The loyal group also presumably includes the 485 people (and counting) who have covered the song since its release in 1984. You may have had the dis/pleasure (or somewhere between) of hearing some of these –– Wham! and (bizarrely) Ashley Tisdale get the most radio play, but the list includes Jimmy Eat World, Hilary Duff, The Cheetah Girls, Taylor Swift, The cast of Glee, Carole King, KC and the Sunshine Band, and Yardfest-hopeful Carly Rae Jepson. And there are, of course, the simply curious, like the operator of the website “last-christmas.com,” who took on the seemingly straightforward task of tallying all these covers (the task may have proved too difficult, as the website is now defunct). </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\" rel=\"text-align: justify;\">These are only a precious few, takes on “Last Christmas” are so varied my four friends and I couldn’t even come to consensus in that corner of Default-House’s kitchen. Though divisive, there are a few indisputable truths about <em>Wham!</em>’s Christmas classic: it is inescapable (according to Billboard, the track was the 10th most played holiday song last week), it is remarkably rhymeless (try to find the pair for “special”), and, now that George Michael has passed away on Christmas day, it is newly tragic. But there’s a shred of silver lining (for the loyalists, at least) to be found in there: “Last Christmas” persisted despite a divided audience for over three decades, and the terrible, but somehow touching coincidence of Michael’s passing seems only to have strengthened fans’ loyalty. Spotify reports since that Michael’s passing yesterday, his music has been streamed 3158 percent more than the day before –– and of his hits, “Last Christmas” was played the most.</p>",

It contained the only couch we owned that it was o.k. to spill fluids on (it was purple leather but already scarred white from the scraping of sixty different hangnails, plus the more trimmed twenty of our parents). That couch was in that same place prior to my conception and has not moved in twenty-one years. Imagine standing still this whole time.<br></p><p>There was also, depending on exactly when we are talking about, any given one of the three different televisions of those two decades. I would say each one lasted almost exactly seven years, but the one in the middle (a large silver cube with a perfectly square button) is to this day the only one I knew how to operate. </p><p>There were also the two masks my parents brought back from Papua New-Guinea. All I know about that six-month escapade<span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"> is that everyone</span> referred to my mother as “Misses Doctor Bill.” My father (Bill) is not a doctor, and the trip was Mom's work assignment. Mom is a journalist. When I watched TV in there the masks would hang around my peripheral vision.</p><p> In 2010 a second television was added to the house. You could say we are now a “Two-TV Family.” What I was really concerned about at the time was that my dad’s teal Volvo S70 had dropped dead as a stone, following the white Volkswagen convertible my mother had driven just out of college (at age four we would roll up to preschool with me in the front seat of the convertible, top down, standing up with my sunglasses dangling off my face), and now every car I had ever/would ever love had been scrapped for parts. Actually I’m not sure the parts of either of those vehicles have ever done anyone any good. I did not want another television.</p><p>Anyway with the addition of the so-called “Basement TV” the den got a little bit stiffed. The Basement TV was larger and, unlike the den, you could see the screen from any given seat on the couch. So then there was this room in our house that had once been a real part of our lives that someone, anyone, probably entered approximately once a week. Sometimes, when I am home, I take phone calls in there. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/media/tmp/television.png\" style=\"width: 679px; height: 923px; display: block; margin: auto;\" width=\"679\" height=\"923\" alt=\"\"></p>",

		"title" : "I Liked Television More When It Was Bad",
		"slug" : "ILikedTelevisionMoreWhenItWasBad",
		"body" : "<p>If watching TV was a sport, there was a time in my life in which I would have qualified for  Olympic gold. When I was about nine years old I spent more time watching TV than most people spend working. I can recite the first episode of <i>Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy</i> verbatim. I can name so many characters from <i>The Fairly Oddparents</i> that it’s slightly disturbing. I know enough commercial jingles to fill a jukebox.</p><p>\tMy taste in TV was completely indiscriminate—I watched everything from <i>Thomas the Tank Engine </i>to <i>Wife Swap.</i> <i>Unwrapped </i>and <i>The Barefoot Contessa </i>on the Food Network. <i>Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide </i>and <i>George Lopez </i>on Nick at Nite. Both American and Japanese versions of <i>Ninja Warrior. </i>That one game show where you get cash prizes for trying to put your body through increasingly small holes in sheets of foam.</p><p>\tThe only place I drew the line was the <i>Disney Channel</i>, as I thought myself above the network's tendency towards middle-school histrionics about boys and clothes and makeup. In retrospect it seems hard to justify my standards of intellectual and artistic merit when it included the Home Shopping Network and <i>Diners, Drive-ins and Dives</i> <i>with Guy Fieri</i>.</p><p>\tThe point is—I watched utter crap, without irony, and enjoyed it. I’d come home from school, diligently fill out my math and grammar worksheets, and proceed to sit in front of the tube until it was time to go to bed. I don’t think anyone really understood the depth of my TV habit. My elementary school friends suffered under tight restrictions on “screen time” and parroted their elitist parents by saying things like “We don’t even <i>own</i> a TV” or “I’m much too busy to watch TV” both of which made me roll my eyes so hard my pupils were in danger of getting permanently glued to my skull. As such the conversation never progressed much from there. My parents seemed equally oblivious— I mentioned my pathological love of television to them a few weeks back and they seemed unfazed, as if that whole thing was a dream they’d forgotten.</p><p>\tOver time, my TV habit waned. With my discovery of Netflix and Hulu and eventually, torrenting, I didn’t have to unconsciously flip through channel upon channel of crap anymore. In middle and high school I kept up with a few shows here and there, but no longer with the same mindless, compulsive quality. This last semester I watched an episode of <i>Black Mirror </i>and that was it.</p><p>\tIt’s strange to have become a Person Who Does Not Really Watch TV. Mostly I just feel ashamed. When my mother or a hairdresser asks me if I’ve been watching anything good recently, I pause for an awkward amount of time to think of an answer that makes me sound the least like an asshole. I want to say that it’s not that I’m <i>above </i>TV, it’s just that I haven’t been watching it. But the thing is: there is no way to say “I haven’t been watching much TV these days” without implying that you have better things to do. I hear myself mumble “I just don’t really have the time” and think of all those people I rolled my eyes at when I was a kid. I hear my younger self say: “Really? You don’t have 30 minutes to watch <i>Atlanta </i>or <i>Westworld </i>or even <i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians? </i>What happened to you?”</p><p>\tWhile part of it is, of course, that I’ve changed, TV has also changed along with me. When I was a kid, my approach to TV wasn’t teleological. I didn’t watch particular shows— I just <i>watched</i>. I felt no need to find out what happened next in <i>Degrassi</i> or <i>Ace of Cakes</i> or <i>Spongebob Squarepants—</i> what I was looking for was a strange numb meditative state in which I could empty out my mind and just tune in.</p><p>\tNow it’s much harder, I find, to get this sort of a fix from TV.  With the advent of streaming services I can now watch whatever I want. In this context, why would I pick <i>Wife Swap </i>over <i>Game of Thrones?</i> <i>Semi-Homemade Cooking with Sandra Lee </i>over <i>Broad City</i>? Even if I chose to watch an objectively bad show, it’s still a <i>choice</i>. Watching TV becomes way to engage with culture the same way I’d go see a well-reviewed movie or buy a book a friend recommends.</p><p>\tSome would argue that the analogue to my younger self’s compulsive TV consumption is the Netflix binge. But even when I mindlessly click “Next Episode,” I’m still working towards an end goal of <i>having watched the show—</i> it’s still fundamentally <i>productive</i>. To put it another way: I would never have admitted to watching six consecutive hours of <i>Deal or No Deal </i>the same way I’d humblebrag about binging the entirety of, say, <i>Rick and Morty </i>in one night.</p><p>\tI admit that this could all be facile, an over-intellectualization. Maybe I stopped watching so much bad TV simply because I found better things to do. And maybe my life is better for the fact that I don’t spend 9 hours a day catatonic in front of a flashing screen. But either way, when I came home from break to find my brother watching his third hour of <i>Family Feud, </i>I’d never felt more at home. </p>",

		"body" : "<p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">2016 has been one of those years.</p><p>            I remember having a similar feeling back in 2009. It was at a New Year Party my parents had forced me to join. I was a spongy middle schooler in the midst of despairing adults who had lost their jobs, their prospects for parenthood, their self-esteem after a divorce, but who somehow still found the irony in themselves to grit their teeth and celebrate the coming of another year.</p><p>For them, 2010 seemed to present the possibility for actual happiness, and I, pubescent and confused, believed in the potential of a<em> new decade</em>. For me, 2009 hadn’t been all that bad, except for the fact that 8th grade had come for me with all its saturnian force. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that over the past year, everywhere I went I had unwittingly absorbed from each adult interaction a fraction of the weighty gloom the real world entrusts on Big Kids. In my adolescent bubble, there were sparkly vampires and ship-names for the cooler kids; everywhere else there was desperation, the sort that you could smell on people brushing past you in the street.</p><p>            And though we managed to leave electric eye shadow and midriffs and Bushes of the George kind in the 2000s, the <em>next decade</em> hasn’t been quite as rosy as I had envisioned as a thirteen year-old.</p><p><br></p><p>It's the end of 2016 and</p><p>            The Middle East looks less like its Exotic Self and more like Middle Earth.</p><p>            Three college kids were murdered in a café this summer as a result of the Bangladeshi terrorist renaissance.</p><p>            Speaking of the renaissance, the French have been having a rough year.</p><p>            Turkey is highly flammable and should be washed with caution.</p><p>            Britain is imploding.</p><p>            Europe, for that matter, is imploding.</p><p>            The Elections… happened.</p><p>            Girls are still disappearing because it appears that <em>Western education is sin.</em></p><p>            Orlando fell victim to similar delusions.</p><p>            I heard something about Global Warming¿</p><p>            Vlad is really losing it.</p><p>            Millions of celebrities, and probably some others, passed away.  </p><p><br></p><p>            There’s also a ridiculous amount of cheery information that we aren’t privy to, so there’s that. It’s of no relevance that the US is decimating seven different countries that reek of third world, and that WE never hear  about it because we much prefer first world tinsel, right?</p><p style=\"margin-left: 340px;\">                                                            *******</p><p style=\"margin-left: 340px;\"><br></p><p>            Thinking about everything that has happened in 2016, I’m confronted by this strange cognitive dissonance. Despite a painful awareness of the above, I can’t help but satisfy the pearly ritual of New Year’s resolutions. The futility of making promises I know I will never keep is deafeningly apparent, but there’s something to be said about the comfort of self-absorption in the midst of all this sadness. What’s more is that I have this morsel of hope – the tiniest wisp – that things can actually get better once 2017 comes around. Perhaps Saint Nicholas finally knew to lug two-states, internet enlightenment and a miracle diet around in his celestial chariot.</p><p>            I don’t know, it might all just be youthful idealism. The more I think about it, the less distant middle school becomes, and though the setting is different the sentiment is familiar. The 1930s were, it would seem, not all that long ago either.</p><p>            In the end we’re espoused to the idea of time - standard chunks of life in solar units - so it’s probably for the best to keep the marriage healthy by not having expectations. People expected the world to end in 2012, and what a disappointment that was. So, it's probably best to take things at face value. 2009 was just another year. Maybe 2016 was also just another year, and maybe we should give 2017 the chance to surprise.</p>            <strong><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><strong>Happy Year’s End.</strong></p></strong>",

The trembling potential, the shimmering radial line this diner-owner is shot down has broken past the browser feed and into the grassroots themselves, into the chrome of the American diner. </p><p>That same trembling and shaking, haunting and apocalyptic potential of the radial man is now in Nebraska’s grass itself.

They call this <em>the Hourglass effect </em>[2].</p><p>The heartland is murmuring. The Alt-Right communicates through event horizon messaging and so does the grass itself. The drop of anything brought by Google into our heartland has shot down the radial American man down the radial line, and ripped the voice of Cain right out of hell.

And if there’s one thing that I know about sailing, about Marblehead, about the Yacht club, and about the Mooring family, it’s that a sailboat only docks right into the mooring when the sail’s boom is aligned just right, and a sail’s boom has to be aligned just right, precise something fierce, to all them magnetic fields. No, they don’t call it a boom because it’s easy to align. And they don’t call them the Moorings because they’re poor. And you’ll never win the lottery by learning how to sail.</p><p> It’s hard for a young boy to learn to sail without the resources offered by the Marblehead Yacht club. The club is full to the brim with strapping, old men. Men who know things. Men with sayings and knowings and platitudes. I hear. They will tell a young boy a thing or two. And that young boy can take those things they got told and learn how to sail. </p><p> Otherwise, a young boy will never know how to sail. He’ll never be a man like his father was. All these old men at the club are fathers. Fathers who speak in turns of foot. Fathers who know a thing or two. They know that they don’t call it college because it’s easy. And that sometimes you’re holding the glove in the wrong hand.</p><p> The point is that it takes all these old boys from the Marblehead Yacht club to teach a boy to sail. It takes the whole village. It takes a village of fathers.</p>",

It’s floated in rice porridge, pebbled over greens, nested inside lotus-wrapped rice squares. Perhaps most remarkably, in certain traditional varietals of mooncake, the whole preserved yolk hangs, orange & globular, in the pastry’s lotus-paste sky. Most remarkably—that is to say—until just recently.</p><p>The <i><em>liu sha bao</em></i> emerged in Hong Kong, my childhood hometown, less than ten years ago—a newborn star in a modern South China food constellation already crowded with everything from the <i><em>cha shao bao</em></i> (barbecue pork bun) to the <i><em>dou sha bao</em></i> (red bean paste bun) to the <i><em>han bao bao</em></i> (…hamburger). The <i><em>liu sha bao</em></i>, modeled on any number of dim sum classics, is steamed and white and filled with sweet salted-egg custard. “<i><em>Liu sha</em></i>” translates to “flowing sand”, a textural approximation for goopy custard grained with solid bits of yolk: picture a bun stuffed with egg quicksand. The public responded voraciously. The <i><em>liu sha bao</em></i> ascended rapidly to dim sum’s eternal pantheon, to be packed ever-after into bamboo steamers and trollied hurriedly between tables all busy Sunday mornings from then on. Its liquid gold flowed on south; washed up in Singapore, my other & more recent hometown; flowed on.</p><p>Next stop: the croissant. A humble halal bakery in Singapore’s heartland east, the story goes, was first to think of piping salted egg custard into wholesale-sourced croissants. From there the rest is weeks of hours-long queues and history. (Queuing is a principal national pastime. The longer we wait to acquire some treasured and elusive something, the savvier we—in theory—get to feel.) A few years into its rise, the salted egg croissant belongs to the plane of shared consciousness, of mandatory Singaporean experience. One simply may not try it less than once. The ones at BreadTalk are tiny, buy-4-get-1-free, and advertised as full of “golden lava”, and though I'd feared some sort of brininess, the croissant's as custardy as the steamed bun from which it’s plagiarized. I eat the two I’ve bought so rapidly I can’t quite process that they’re gone yet, and keep turning their plastic bag over expecting another; the last savor of<i> <em>liu sha</em></i> in my mouth is sweet and smooth-gritty and, yes, lingeringly eggy.</p><p>From here the salted-egg moon’s the limit. A kiosk in a mall today calls itself “Singapore’s Original Salted Egg Snacks,” exclusively vending salted-egg-yolk potato chips and salted-egg-yolk dried fish skin strips. Take your all-American staples, the chocolate lava cake, the jelly donut; we raise you Salted Egg Yolk Lava Cake and <i><em>Liu Sha</em></i> Custard Doughnuts. Salted Egg Yolk Cream Puff? French Toast? Ice Cream? Milkshake? Latte? Toothpaste? Move over, durian, red bean, pandan: this is the Singapore flavor ascendant. The queues calm down. The commodities multiply. I luxuriate.</p><p>In a week or two I’ll walk, sated and salt-smelling, into a local dim sum place at peak hour. I’ll order a pair of Charcoal <em>Liu Sha</em> Buns: classic flavor with a largely visual twist. I’ll pierce an airy black bun with a chopstick and let its gold leak. It’ll be maybe my two-dozenth salted-egg purchase; home has changed since I left it and I am determined to catch up, determined to ford even this growing gulf between cherished and known things. I’ll recall the plastic-bagged donuts I ate as a child in Hong Kong, fried, sugar-granulated, fat with dark bean paste. The first<i> liu sha bao</i> I ever ate and wrinkled up my (picky foreign eater) face at. The croissants at Panera and Tatte and Paris Baguette, the ones that come in cans at Walmart, the ones I’ll bake someday, in an Anglo-American life, and their buttered airy space within. <i><em>Liu sha</em></i>'s smooth migration from Hong Kong to Singapore, and my translocation to Boston, where salted egg will surely never follow. A vision of mashing brined duck eggs with a teaspoon or whisk. The way home seeps into flavor and binds to receptors on the tongue, the way the child abroad grows into reckoning [stumblingly] her sense of place and self. The liminal stage of the croissant. Schrödinger’s sugared donut.</p>",

Idioms and platitudes as a truly American means of expression. Cain’s anger has become the broken man. The legless father. Most think that an idiom of happiness and anger can let us express the complexes we feel inside. It is a means of community. But why is this idiom not the thought itself. Something we would not have if it did not exist. Why is it that we don’t have the simpleton Cain’s anger deep inside us. And we cease its trembling (of happy or sad or anger) by saying our sayings. That our thoughts are not our own, but they are only our saying. We do not think, we think what we say, the sayings, the hell of Cain, the brother. The sayings and knowings are a shooting line and star, complex cosmos, and astrological insight, and lightened miscue. We feel Cain, we hurt Abel, we express from the conspiratorial theorist the sayings of our Midwestern grandparents, we shout and we only think what we shout, our outcries of pleasing senses and drained swamps. The platitude gives us a thought, is our thought, and is nothing else.</p><p> But it’s not that platitudes are a way to funnel in our complex emotions into simple phrases. We have simple and deep and dark, hellish feelings, shiverings. And we can express these through platitudes, saying and knowings that have existed through our generations, radial thoughts for radial men that we can shoot ourselves down. We don’t have thoughts, we have Cain’s anger, root anger, we have a rootless tree, we have someone else’s platitude. The platitude is not a failure of language or a means to expression, it is the expression. Without it, there could be no expression, no feeling and no thought. </p><p> The Carpenter’s play through supermarkets across Oklahoma, and they teach its sweet citizens to feel happiness, that there is a pleasing sense of happiness for me.  Happiness is a trembling. Animated inanimate. The pleasing platitude can turn this shaking nonsense into good-hearted American expression. Yet, the woman singing is at gunpoint. Our saying are the rootless trees, and they always fall first. A need for clean. </p><p>They are sayings of our people, the sole radial line for us to channel Cain’s anger, the words are a medium for the platitude, for the radial thought. An anger most basic and base and rote, something that is simply an inner object, pulsed through a man, whose thoughts are not his own. The  talk can express the anger, but only insofar as the anger and the talk is not the talker’s, but rather they are the culture and the line’s.</p>",

You do it enough times to become accustomed to it and then it is banal. \"You can normalize,\" says LCD Soundsystem in the song \"Get Innocuous.\" He goes on: \"Don't it make you feel alive?\" The reality is that normalizing makes me feel dead. Everything and anything can be decathected. The world around us triggers emotions and these make our heart race and then we feel ourselves living. Acclimation neutralizes everything into the same tone of grey. </p><p>For me planes are moving in the opposite direction of normalization. I've been flying since before I could make permanent memories: as a kid planes were a place for Gameboy Advance and those beverage carts specially designed to fit through the aisles. I would always get apple juice and cranberry juice mixed together. If I forgot to ask for no ice I would then be committed to leaving my tray table down until it melted. Plane drinks are a commitment: you have to down the whole thing or you're stuck with thick off-white plastic impeding your mobility. </p><p>These days it gets harder every time; I am convinced that airline policy is not to tell the passengers about impending doom until it is totally inevitable, that the pilots are looking wide-eyed at each other like we are all going to die, this is the time it really happens, this is where we go down. Hurtling through the sky in metal canisters is totally ridiculous and kind of a whole new Babel. Whoever thought that the way to get anywhere fastest was to do so a mile above the surface of the Earth. </p><p>If you had enough money you could move through the spaces of air travel perpetually, never seeing the outside. You move through security and into controlled travel-space, the moving walkways and endless corridors of people taking themselves and their carry-ons from one place to another. When you leave you are still enclosed in the jet bridge, moving down a telescoping tunnel which suctions onto the plane and then post-flight moving up another into different and second airport when you land. Airports in the States are all alike: Hudson News, Starbucks, some kind of diner. You could be anywhere. </p><p>Borders between countries are not only at the lines on a map but at the various locations where customs happens. The political wormhole: an arbitrary and diffuse boundary lying somewhere in between passport control and baggage recheck. Before they put the stamp on your passport you are nowhere at all.

		"body" : "<p>A towering archway straddles the cobbled artery that leads to Prague's Old Town Square. It's stoic and unyielding, and it announces that you are entering a district that is Very Old and Very Czech. With bated breath, the main street scurries past a fleet of picturesque buildings, exhaling grandly onto the bustling plaza. From the last week of November to the first week of January, the plaza is home to Prague’s Christmas Market, a sugar-dusted precinct of holiday spirit so idyllic that even the Christian Right could not shake a fist to it. (Baroque church spires loom vigilantly over the smorgasbord of tinsel and chocolate—it’s the kind of capitalism that Our White Lord Jesus Christ would have been okay with.)</p><p>The businesses that orbit the square—sitting pleasantly along the main street and its neighbors—cling to a similar Old World charm. The district is home to quaint bakeries and stores selling Bohemian garnet jewelry, with requisite souvenir shops peppered in between. The echo of boots on cobblestone assures you that your expensive plane ticket truly transported you Elsewhere, but there exist numerous outcroppings for the average American tourist to grab onto, white-knuckled, when the smell of cabbage and consonant-riddled tongue prove too much to bear. A wax sculpture of Bruce Willis posing in the window of a Madame Tussaud’s franchise. A <em>Minions</em> snow globe. An illustrated menu, rendered in cloudless blue English. That the neighborhood most frequented by tourists exists to make Americans comfortable is not shocking to me. What takes me by surprise is the area’s plentiful spread of Thai massage parlors.</p><p>My dad and I count three on one street alone—and when I say “Thai massage parlors,” I don’t mean generic spa businesses that happen to be staffed by Southeast Asian women. I mean that each establishment boldly proclaims that its MASSAGES are THAI. The salons are somewhat uniform in their decor; they forgo the usual cooing whites and blues and opt for screaming shades of absinthe green. One storefront features a digital display: a rapid-fire montage of clients in soothed repose, followed by a boldfaced price that spirals violently onto the screen. 9.99 €! If numbers and currency signs could be written in capitals, these would be. Just looking at all of it makes my blood pressure spike. I am not having a good time. I am not relaxed. Maybe I need a massage. </p><p>Why does the tourist district of Prague harbor such an insatiable demand for THAI MASSAGES specifically? I grasp for analogues—the chicken tikka masala that appears on the menu of every London pub, maybe, or the plethora of Indonesian restaurants in Amsterdam—but no imperial history comes to mind. Although its neighbors were once holdings of the French and British, Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country to have never been colonized by Europeans. According to Wikipedia, the largest Asian immigrant population in the Czech Republic hails from Vietnam. Although massage is a medical discipline in Thailand, a generic, non-medicinal practice of the trade has become popular in various European countries since the 1990’s. My cursory Google investigation does little to inform me why <em>three</em> Thai massage salons compete for business on a single street in Prague. </p><p>There is, of course, a lascivious scent to the lucrative massage business, and the wink-nudge assumptions that always seem to accompany young Asian women in service jobs. (What's vacation, after all, without internalized biases?) An expert at praguemassage.net informs me that the many of the city’s salons offer “happy ending massages,” although most businesses on the tourist path are only good for an “unsatisfying rubdown.\" Every Man, he insists, Should Know THIS About Praha Massage Parlours. </p><p>Still, some of the parlors glow with thinly-veiled lewdness. Prostitution is legal in Prague unless it's organized. With leggy mannequins sprawling under colored neon signs, the windows of the salons recall those that line Amsterdam’s Red Light District. Thai Paradise, a second-story establishment, indulges the voyeuristic urges of the passerby. From street level, you can look up and see clients shin-deep in tanks of pedicure fish, relaxing as the hungry little swimmers devour the dead skin on their feet. (It’s worth noting that the “doctor fish” spa treatment did not originate in Thailand.) </p><p>The visceral garishness of it all wouldn’t be out of place in Amsterdam or Las Vegas or a flaming convertible barreling toward Flavortown, U.S.A. (You are bound and gagged in the passenger seat. Guy Fieri cackles from behind the wheel. Rascal Flatts's “Life is a Highway” is playing, and NOT in a fun, nostalgic way.) But we’re in <em>Prague</em>, as the glass and porcelain wares of neighboring shops insist. On a solitary walk through the neighborhood, I make a stop at Thai Paradise. I am greeted by a man dressed in a conical Chinese farmer’s hat, a neon green silk robe, and, bizarrely, a Shrek mask. My favorite Scottish-accented ogre ushers me into the red-carpeted, Buddha-laden building. Plastic lotus flowers line the staircase. He invites me to luxuriate in his Oriental swamp.</p><p>Upstairs, it’s quiet. The clients are not horny bachelors looking for massages of the wink-nudge variety. A young woman sips tea on the couch while another pays at the counter. The young women working at the reception desk are blonde-haired and blue-eyed, dressed in clingy red velvet outfits with white fur trim: Santa Claus costumes pulled straight out of the <em>Mean Girls</em> talent show. It’s January 3rd. Even Thai Paradise, which does not seem to yield to any cultural or national boundaries, cannot resist Prague’s extended holiday season. The <em>Minions</em> snowglobes and Bruce Willis sculpture cater obviously to the displaced American—to whom does this technicolored, vaguely Pan-Asian, Christmas-observant, seemingly atemporal space speak? I trod wearily down the staircase, stepping into the sunken spots of carpet that have met many feet before mine.</p>",

Dismemberment has been at once permitted –– celebrated even ––  by the Church and considered the greatest of abominations. When the Murder Act of 1751 was passed in Great Britain, for example, the punishment for all criminals executed on murder offenses was a public dissection and subsequent display of the stripped corpse. That same year, William Hogarth published a threatening series of engravings following the life of a criminal from childhood to his public execution. The fourth and final engraving, <em>The Reward of Cruelty</em>, shows Nero’s body, hanged, cut from the gallows, and spread on a surgeon’s table in a crowded anatomical theatre as three men set about taking him apart.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the same time, however, the Church had made a habit of saving and displaying the various “relics” (read: body parts) of monarchs and saints. Only eight years later, King George II of England, prescribed in his last will and testament that his body be separated after death. His body would be opened and treated with oils. His viscera would be removed and embalmed. His heart would be tended to on its own. When the embalming proceedings concluded, George II’s corpse would be buried in Westminster Abbey, the heart, separately, in a Georgian vault.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stephen and Thomas Amidon described this phenomenon in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B009NPNW30/atlaobsc01-20\"><em>The Sublime Engine: A Biography of the Human Heart</em></a>: \"The dispersed burial of monarchs and other dignitaries was common. After Henry I’s death in Normandy in 1135 from eating poisonous eels, his heart was sewn into the hide of a bull for preservation and transported back to England to be buried, while the rest of him was interred where it was. The heart of England’s Richard I — whose nickname, Coeur de Lion (Lionheart), is rumored to have come from his ripping out and consuming the heart of a lion to acquire its courage — had his legendary cardiac muscle buried separately from his other remains.\"</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This uncertain stance on division might stem from the Bible –– which is equally ambiguous on the subject. Corinthians, for example, seems to insist upon unity: “God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the parts that lack it, so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other” (Corinthians 12:24-25, NIV). </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But following line seems to undermine that sentiment: “If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it,” (Corinthians 12:26, NIV), suggesting (apparently without judgement) that whatever treatment inflicted on a part, will also extend to the total being. So there might be a shred of resolution to be found. Perhaps it’s not that the practice had any one moral valence, but that it functioned as a means of honoring or profaning the parts as stand-ins for the whole: multiplying their sacredness or sacrilege precisely by dividing it. </p>",

It is also a play on computer graphics and traditional animation techniques, as every frame was drawn and photographed using a pane of glass laid over a still image on a computer screen. Animation is a physical means to habitually re-encounter the same figure and to confront it’s changing form as it moves through space.

These recordings, bouncing and caroming off the atmosphere, can be heard from any location on earth and their source cannot be traced. Messages began to appear on these frequencies during World War I, and their content was mysterious and diverse: a female voice reciting strings of numbers in Czech, a child’s voice singing in German, a short, disembodied melody played by an old music box.</p>  <p>The recordings, it was discovered, were encrypted messages for the purpose of espionage. To this day, we are unable to decode many of the messages, nor do we know their senders nor their recipients. These looped recordings are compiled in <i><em>The Conet Project</em></i>, whose website promises to send an authentic Roman coin to anybody who successfully cracks one of the codes. Perhaps most famously, the title of Wilco’s album <i><em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em></i> comes from a Numbers Station recording that is sampled on the track “Poor Places”.</p>  <p>I have been listening to these recordings a lot, and I have found them to be really meditative. I fall into a repetitive trance, hearing haunting utterings of numbers and letters hum above the static. Unless acted upon otherwise, these recordings will repeat indefinitely. The messages are, in a sense, very isolated attempts at pure communication. Their goal is to be heard, decoded, and interpreted by a single person. But their meanings have largely been lost. In a time when meaningful, authentic, accurate communication between two parties (political or otherwise) seems increasingly hard to come by, this makes one think. In <i><em>Tractatus 5.62</em></i>, Wittgenstein proposes that language creates the limits of our world. In other words, he argues that that which cannot be articulated is essentially meaningless. The Numbers Stations are an interesting case; although the recordings do verifiably have meanings, whether or not we can understand them or not is unknown. The transmissions create a sort of private language; although anybody can hear them, only one person can understand them. There is something poetic, elegant, and kind of sad about the way these recordings sound, steeped in static, droning onward devoid of purpose through the metallic emptiness of space. I could not invent a more artful or elegiac metaphor for the way we communicate.</p>  <p>For anybody who is interested, you can find a lot of the recordings here: </p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSoYU4Rz9Q6xFJ6nPc2zGUPwS_LBzOmUn\">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSoYU4Rz9Q6xFJ6nPc2zGUPwS_LBzOmUn</a></p>  <p>I recommend you listen to them and let them wash over you in all their abstract, spectral creepiness. It makes you think, if nothing else, about what we are trying to do when we attempt to communicate.</p>",

Something something something - something about fathers and sons, about life on earth, life after, the glory of God, or an obsession that could replace it. Looking back, it was foolish of me to read poetry and expect knowledge, to go searching for enlightenment like a Leader could show the Student the answers that would get rid of pain. The Dream Songs didn’t do any of that for me, but what they did instead was rip all of it open.<br></p><p>The book is Berryman’s weapon, the tool he uses to dig far into every potential answer to reveal the sublime chaos beneath it all: God is your father, who is not a thing but is the sky, the road, the path towards death and back. Your father is the world, which heals you. You don’t think about it. You don’t touch it. The world is not life, or death, but deafness, and you can’t seal it. You are, in the midst of it all, the translucent someone. In the absence of clarity, there lies the inextricable You: Father, God, world, Henry, a life, three, and two, and every last entropic string of it. Life-and-love becomes <em>something</em>, and everything horrible that could come from it, becomes the Something of Life before you, radiating from you, caving into you. </p><p>Today marks the forty-fifth year of John Berryman’s death at 58 years old. The topic is disturbing, and for that, fascinating. For writers, what could be more addicting, more overwhelming than encroaching the territory where pain stands, watching, and unblinking? Reading the Dream Songs, I think of the challenge that Berryman brings to humanity, which tells us, in its sparkling purity and its all-encompassing fervor, to made of something.</p>",

		"body" : "<p><br></p><p>“If we don’t ever sleep again, so much the better,” José Arcadio Buendía said in good humor. “That way we can get more out of life.” But the Indian woman explained that the most fearsome part of the sickness of insomnia was not the impossibility of sleeping, for the body did not feel any fatigue at all, but its inexorable evolution toward a more critical manifestation: a loss of memory. She meant that when the sick person became used to his state of vigil, the recollection of his childhood began to be erased from his memory, then the name and notion of things, and finally the identity of people and even the awareness of his own being, until he sank into a kind of idiocy that had no past.<br></p>  <p>—Gabriel García Márquez, <i><em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em></i></p><p><i><em><br></em></i></p>  <p><i></i></p>  <p>I read this, appropriately enough, just after four in the morning, in that languishing time of night when falling asleep is depressingly unlikely and sunrise is equally depressingly far-off. But my insomnia, as I’ve come to know it over the past few years, is not like the sickness Márquez describes. It’s not so much a process of forgetting, as it is the saturation of the present with the past that I experience just after four in the morning, when the silence of the night is broken only by the sound of a garbage truck idling on Dewolfe Street, as it does every morning at precisely this time.</p>  <p>As the boundary separating yesterday from today, or maybe today from tomorrow, becomes blurred, the distant crashes from the street start to seem less real than the gestures and faces of people I haven’t seen in years. They drift past my glazed eyes: Kate, my best friend for several summers, sharp-shouldered and dear to me by the dubious distinction of being the only person I’d ever met who spoke less than I did. My almost equally taciturn grandfather, whose heavy hands had veins of an astonishing violet and whose blue eyes are my father’s eyes and my brother’s. Then there’s my blue-eyed brother, him at five years old, building a fountain in the back yard out of pots and pans and the garden hose. And my mother, as she was then, standing on the shore of a lake and holding my baby brother on her hip, her fingers laced around the base of his spine. The heaviness of sleep, it would seem, is the marble slab on the tomb, the earth in the grave: without it, ghosts walk freely.</p>  <p>Past four in the morning, things float without anchors, unmoored from their times and places. Maybe Márquez is right after all, because the funny thing about my insomniac memories is that, for all their unexpected vividness, they’re orphans, like pearls without string. As the insomnia has grown more frequent, I’ve become notorious for telling the same stories to the same people, each time with the same perplexity at the astonishing psychic powers of my friends. My record: five times, the story of the reindeer stew. Past four in the morning, time turns in a circle and eats its own tail. Have I told you this before?</p>  <p>I guess there’s no way to tell if sleeplessness is the cause, but I’ll blame it for the scrambling of my past. A night without sleep begins with a wide-eyed anxious feeling that always makes me think of the phrase “the watches of the night,” although I wish I knew just what I’m keeping watch for. It ends not with waking up, but with the effort of getting up, which usually feels less like waking than like the beginning of a strange and depressing dream. In the mirror in the cruelly well-lit bathroom, the skin around my eyes is gray tinged with pale pink, through which the blue of the veins is strangely visible. I’m reminded of my grandfather. Time turns in a circle.</p>  <p>It takes a while for my nerve endings to awaken from their sleep-deprived stupor. The journey back from total unconsciousness, which seems like it would be a longer crossing to make, is easier than bringing myself out of this semi-conscious haze. Cold water on my face and the steam rising from a cup of tea are shocking, then miraculous. The solidity of objects is somehow unexpected, outlines seem cut with greater vigor, colors contain an electric charge. The winter sunlight is sharp and clear. Everything is more visible than usual. The present reasserts itself. </p>  <p>I know that this strange elation will vanish by early afternoon, when I’m groggily slumped over black coffee, but I can’t help it. Maybe this is why sleeping pills and earplugs and the nine different herbal supplements I’ve tried so far haven’t worked at all—because I’m in love with these insomnia days. I’ll take these brief lucidities, these scatterings of pearls.</p>",

Oranges, quinces, lemons, kiwis; bananas, watermelon, guava. Even dragonfruit. The most difficult were blueberries, becausenobody ever wanted just one and the girl could only pull a piece at a time. She didn’t mind, though. Nobody else did, either: in her city, fresh fruit was hard to come by, and most people were willing to wait. So it took a long time for her to realize the secret horror of the gift. Because all things considered, fruit is more useful than other kinds of terrible talents. (Her best friend, for example, could produce flowers from any kind of hat, which caused all kinds of problems, like pollen allergies and bee-stings and the inevitable scratchiness of a hat with flowers poking out of it).</p><p><br></p><p>\tNobody cared if a piece of fruit wilted or smelled or scratched. There were no bees. People appreciated the snack.</p><p><br></p><p>\tAs the years went and she got older, the gift-giving became a habit for the girl. Like a necklace she put on every morning and wore out because it was nice to look at and everybody said so. Soon she didn’t have to put it on in the morning because she never took it off at night. Nobody minded her in all that finery, because when it was cold, there were always pineapples for her teachers; apples for her aunties; and plums for her dad. When it was summer her sisters ate clumps of grapes like jewels. She reserved bananas (at all times) for enemies, except they were still appreciative and nobody got hurt and everyone was eating more fruit than their mothers ever packed in any of their school lunch bags.</p><p><br></p><p>\tMore than anything the girl liked giving fruit to strangers. Strangers expected nothing and therefore anything struck them as extraordinary. It was a nice feeling.There was nothing better than seeing a person fed. And no matter the season she liked to be thanked.  She told this to her friend who made flowers. He copied her example. (Most people, it might be noted, can’t eat petals.)</p><p><br></p><p>\tOne day, the boy who made flowers tried to give some to a man who thought it meant something it didn’t.  In the hospital, the walls were not fruit or flower-colored. They were beige. There were no hats and all the pockets had pens or other official implements in them, meant for important things like drawing blood and keeping friends alive. </p><p><br></p><p>\tHolding her hand next to the beige walls he said he didn’t understand why people couldn’t just accept the gifts given them.</p><p>\t“I mostly thought his baseball cap would make some nice daisies.” </p><p>\t\tHe had a cut which bled a little like redcurrant jam.</p><p>\t“Did it?”</p><p>\t“They were nice daisies.”</p><p>\tWhen the girl went home she thought long and hard about flowers and gifts and red-currant jam. <i>She pulled guava after guava out of pocket after pocket. Meanwhile, her friend graduated the hospital; they both graduated the high-school.</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p>\tAt the ceremony, fifty names went mispronounced; three diplomas were missing; and six-hundred posies fell when the graduation caps bloomed mid-air. Her classmates yelled and screamed and laughed. The girl felt sick.</p><p><br></p><p>Afterwards, she folded her gown into a square the size of a pocket. She put it in her car. Then she drove to the the Walgreens (she’d  yet to meet anyone who could pull Ibuprofen out of a hat) where she found the most inspiring pockets she’d ever seen. They belonged to the pharmacist, a woman with night-sky skin and blazing smile and an apron with two front pockets. The girl couldn’t help herself. It took two strangers plus the girl herself to balance, not one; not two; but four watermelons on that drugstore counter. The pharmacist was too confused to help. She tried to decline the strange girl’s attempt to barter fruit-for-Ibifrofen (the one, after all, couldn’t reduce cramps) until finally a melon tipped from the counter and split into shards the size of plates. A manager was called. Complaints were made. There was inevitably more yelling, and the woman with the blazing smile kept smiling even as she scooped watermelon pulp off the carpet. The girl left the store (rolling the offensive fruit into an aisle; here, where it sat for several hours before the pharmacist reclaimed it to take home to her partner: but this happened much later, when the girl lay, watching a cooking show on her couch.)</p><p><br></p><p>\tWatching an apronless chef braise an apricot , the girl swore she’d never make another plum, pluat, or grapefruit, ever, ever again. Lying on her stomach with the TV remote balanced on a seat cushion she swore she’d never do such a self-serving thing as give anyone unrequested fruit. And setting her head onthe pillow she dreamt up nobler, more worthwhile uses of her time: things like Computer Science; remembering to feed the cat; and being kinder to her mother.  </p><p><br></p><p>\tOver time people forgot the girl ever pulled sweet things from jacket pockets. It turned out she was pretty great at coding. Her mom was very appreciative, and so was her cat. </p><p><br></p><p>\t(Both  the pharmacist and  her girlfriend agreed: it was incredible watermelon. The girlfriend couldn’t believe how much her partner loved her, and told her so. That night they had really, really great sex.)</p><p><br></p><p><em>words by Isa Flores-Jones </em><em><em>w/ hands by Camila Ortiz</em></em><br></p>",

		"body" : "<p>The Chainsmokers, those guys are legends. The DJ duo of Drew Taggart and Alex Pall has taken the pop charts by storm over the last year, particularly with their smash hit “Closer” which reigned number one on the Billboard charts for a full 12 weeks, making it, for all intents and purposes, the song of 2016. They’re hot, young, totally chill, and on top of the world.</p>    <p>Perhaps we’re left to wonder how history will remember The Chainsmokers and Closer because we’re left to wonder how history will remember 2016 – the year when <strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/arts/music/prince-dead.html?_r=0\">everyone</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/arts/music/david-bowie-dies-at-69.html\">we</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/04/sports/muhammad-ali-dies.html\">loved</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/19/arts/music/glenn-frey-a-founding-member-of-the-eagles-dies-at-67.html\">passed</a> </strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/world/europe/kenny-baker-r2-d2-star-wars.html\"><strong>away</strong></a> and Donald Trump was elected president. I can only imagine the memories we’ll have of Closer flooding from Uber radios, dining hall serveries, and party rooms (somehow always playing but never at your own volition) will intertwine in the soup of our subconscious with our memories of the election (it was rocking out at number 1 on November 7<sup>th</sup>).</p>    <p>Over the course of 2016, and into this year, waves of well-meaning and confused people have tried to hit the books (and encourage others to do so) in order to understand the rise of Donald Trump. The mini trend of the \"Trump Syllabus\" developed in which a few publications put together <strong><a href=\"http://www.chronicle.com/article/Trump-Syllabus/236824\">mock</a> </strong><a href=\"http://www.publicbooks.org/feature/trump-syllabus-20\"><strong>syllabi</strong></a> for their readers to get versed on the body of history and theory that might allow people to contextualize the political turn of events.</p>    <p>I propose one addition: in order to perhaps even better understand the conditions that lead to Trump’s election, we might also want bolster our reading with an immediate historicization of the pop culture landscape of the year. By getting a sense of the ethos of the media that Americans consumed en masse over the course of 2016, we might get a sense of the sort of culture that prospectively put Trump in the White House. The first step might be understanding Closer, and if we want to understand Closer, we have to understand the place that the song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zGcUoRlhmw\"><strong>wistfully remembers</strong></a>: Boulder, Colorado. </p>    <p>I could go on and try to have a hot take on what Boulder means in the culture – some natural paradise where people from across the country who love come to hike, hit the slopes, smoke legal pot, and unironically celebrate the grand life of being a certain type of person in a certain part of America without worrying too much about it – but it might just be better to let the words and pictures speak for themselves. Here’s some curated Boulder clips, captioned with excerpts from Chris Martins’ <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/7510387/the-chainsmokers-billboard-cover-closer\"><strong>questionable profile</strong></a> of The Chainsmokers in <i>Billboard </i>from September.

		"body" : "<p>It’s Friday last week and I’m accompanying my mother on one of those annual visits to the <i><em>doctor</em>. </i>I’m thinking about how it used to be the other way round when I was younger - accompaniment was a grown-up enterprise entirely, and the idea of going anywhere at all by myself would mean tumbling into the jaws of the world of strangers and their lairs for lost children. Emerging from my thoughts, I check my wristwatch: we have been sitting in the waiting room for just over an hour, and I, all too rapidly, seem to be running out of patience.<br></p>  <p>It’s not that I’m not used to waiting, or that there’s some environmental quality to the beige-grey waiting room that makes me physically uncomfortable; rather, I have never been in the presence of so many pregnant women all at once. Bellies bulging like those of malnourished children – nature has a mind of its own – the women have more than simply the obvious in common. On their faces blooms a stifling range of expressions from desperation to rage to queasiness to severe annoyance, and the more I watch them, the build up of carbon dioxide in the room becomes all the more apparent. Some waiting together with whom I assume are their husbands, others nodding off in solitude, the mothers-to-be make up the majority of the waiting room population. My mother appears older to me than ever before, and suddenly my stomach mocks me with a ghost’s kick.</p>  <p> Last month I finished Ian McEwan’s <i><em>The Children Act</em>. </i>Despite the mixed reviews the novel received, I found it an enjoyable read, and sitting in the waiting room my mind goes to the protagonist. Fiona the perimenopausal judge who never had the time to procreate grapples with marital hiccups (her andropausal husband declares he is going to have an affair with a younger woman because he is unsatisfied with their sex life), and later proselytises a young cancer patient who momentarily sees the light. McEwan fashions a literary universe out of <i><em>adult</em></i> themes such as religion, childlessness, medicine and the law, and propriety as presented through Fiona’s perspective. He brings moral obligation in conflict with impulse, with the inner child, and analysing the unyielding presence of the inner child is the keystone to understanding the project of the novel. </p>  <p>As I think back to the book, watching my kinswomen as they gently stroke their own (literal) inner children, I’m struck by the craziness of the whole thing – time, adulthood, aging, childrearing… It is at this point that I realise that some things are truly, uniquely in the eye of the beholder. The individual who undergoes change is often totally unaware of what is going on; time is lost to the one who looks into the mirror each day. Yet, every inch of growth is shockingly apparent to aunts and uncles visited twice a year, though the extra unit of height has essentially no effect in terms of expanding vision. I have this theory that growing up entails a dulling of the senses – diminishing returns to sensation, perhaps. The more you age, stronger tastes like wine, black coffee and spicy food are necessary to make you feel something.  I think about the amount of times others have told me: “you’re not a child anymore,” and then my mind wanders to my grandmother, who at 73 tells me her wrinkles are from laughter: her inner child is as animate as they come. She is one of the happiest people I have ever met, and the most important attribute to her personality, more sun-like than sunny, is that she actively creates her own happiness.<br></p>  <p>The point is not that maturity is affectation. We’re susceptible to biochemistry as much as we’re affected by weather phenomena, and to an extent childhood is, like all good things, impermanent. Still, childhood is a temporal landmark that has permeable boundaries, and how much we are willing to let go of it entirely is an individual decision. In other words, how much we sour depends on how incompatible we think innocent humour is with the quasi-serious business of life. At 20, I don’t seem to feel very different to how I did a few years ago, and it's peculiar to think that my grandma had her first child at 19. How did she manage to hold onto her son's hand with her left and walk, gripping onto the hand of her own childhood with her right? It's strange to be at this artificial gateway, and waiting for my mother’s physician with the prophetic women, I feel closer to them than I do to my childhood. A threatening moment of clarity.</p><p>And then I giggle because this entire collection of musings is ineffectual and weird.</p>",

Ray Kroc is nobody. He’s an idea. A Placeholder. How do we know this? His character is plastic. He has misgivings, but they are only intimations. He drinks too much, he tramples his fellow man, he estranges his wife. Does he lament these qualities? We do not know. Does he desire like a man desires? Surely not. His are the desires of capital: expansion, accumulation, domination – never demonstrated within the experience of his person, but only suggested in the rabidity of Keaton’s eyes, the frenetics of his motion: skewed bites of burger, zigzagging approaches to golf partners, quasi-humping of the hood of the McDonald brothers’ car. </p>    <p>BJ Novak tells him delphically: you must own land. And Ray Kroc proceeds to. He goes to franchise plot after franchise plot and picks up the soil. He runs it through his fingers. Why? Because he must hold the land. Does he own the land? Is he a God, we wonder? Does the land quake for him or does he quake for the land? He trembles before it, but it’s his dominion. He loves two women, maybe one, but the dirt is his only orgasm. </p>    <p>Ray Kroc is a homesteader. His franchises, family farms. They populate the Heart, or perhaps the Gut. Des Plaines, Dayton, Minneapolis. This, we see, can be the only real seat of desire. There grows. And is there more joy than that? To have no boss and no father and to grow. </p>    <p>There is no father, but is Kroc religious? It’s hard to say. He has no Passion, but many Gods. Dick McDonald is the zealot, clear. He believes that capital has a birth, a home, a name. He’s the ideologue. We learn Kroc became large because he was not so deceived. </p>    <p>What does Ray Kroc desire? Only to have a name. To have an American name. To be a McDonald. He only wants to become a man. An American man. And he does so in the only way he knows how: to be the master of land and capital. Kroc tells McDonald as much. All he wanted was to be him. Growth was his only means of transference. Growth made him someone else. Becoming someone else made him himself. And that’s what it means to be an American man.</p>",

		"body" : "<p>The air of urgency came as little surprise. It read in the face of the woman who closed her parchment store early for a front row seat. It read in the wringing hands of the man who wore a Hillary campaign hat and a fixed scowl in upper left corner of the auditorium. It read in the feet of a pack of book-toting poetry students rushing over late from their Monday night workshop. The silence that sits before speech had never felt so fitting.</p><p>A poetry reading was held in the basement of the Cambridge Public Library this past Monday, the 30th of January, to premiere a deceptively small and unassuming chapbook of thirty-five different poets titled \"Poems for Political Disaster.\" It was jointly hosted by the library staff and <i>Boston Review</i>, with <i>Review </i>poetry editor B.K. Fisher making the opening remarks. To be introduced on the panel to her side were Lucie Brock-Broido, Jorie Graham, Major Jackson, Ricardo Maldonado, Nathan Xavier Osorio, Monica Youn, and Peter Gizzi.</p><p>The chapbook posits itself as a reaction to Donald Trump's election, but the content and combated crises are world-spanning. The exercises in memory and resistance are equally universal. U.S. Poet Laureate Juan Felipe Herrera writes in the foreword, \"Guess what, America? Everyone in this rough-cut, deep-hearted chapbook loves you as much as they have fought with you and for you. Everyone here wants an American home, an American national house in a global neighborhood...\"</p><p>Some of the poets read from their own featured work, while others opted to give voice to the chapbook's absent contributors. Brock-Broido, clad in all black and with impossibly long hair pooling onto the podium, delivered a chilling recitation of her poem “The American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act.” The others followed, often prefacing their pieces with a few more colloquial or bitter words about the state of world power. By the close of the hour, the audience had met with intense applause such titles as “Safe House” by Solmaz Sharif, “Ferguson” by Major Jackson, “America! America!” by Ricardo Maldonado, and “A Guide to Usage: Mine” by Monica Youn. The final poem of the night, and one fittingly near to the back cover of the chapbook itself, was Brenda Hillman’s deftly imagistic “Poem of Hope, Almost at Equinox.” </p><p>After the closing words, I caught up with <i>Boston Review’s</i> Stefania Heim. We agreed that it was clear that the success and solidarity of the night also demanded momentum. The audience’s respite in this emergency political response was evident—many met in the hall for minutes afterward to linger on striking lines and pressing ideas. The greater artistic community, it seemed, is embroiled in direct communication with international political order. This communication has turned to argument, but the contributors to “Poems for Political Disaster” uphold that there is no stronger fighting force than an uninhibited creative mind. The <i>Boston Review</i> editors appeared confident that many similar events will take place in the immediate future.</p>",

		"slug" : "14SoundsofSuzanneCianisFuture",
		"body" : "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a 2011 article for GQ, John Jeremiah Sullivan opens with one of those long, self-referential ledes about the story he was assigned (the future of the human race), the story he ‘thought he had’ (a look into the Future of Humanity Institute at Oord University in England), and the story he ultimately found (a fundamental change in the nature animal aggression toward humans) –– the kind of delightful decoy lede that seems to take you away from the story but actually crystallizes its central theme. When Sullivan finally gets to his nugget –– the idea that takes him from ‘the future of the human race’ to animal attacks––– it seems simultaneously obvious and unbelievable: “<em>no one knows what’s going to happen in the future.</em>”<br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A minute of reflection will prove this claim true. No one is a fortune teller. There may be the odd Michael Moore election <a href=\"http://michaelmoore.com/trumpwillwin/\"><strong>prediction</strong></a> or Twitter <a href=\"http://www.bet.com/music/2017/02/02/this-twitter-account-predicted-beyonces-pregnancy.html\"><strong>account</strong></a> that knew about Beyonce’s twins seven months before the world did –– but those usually amount to chance or to psychopathically genius tweeting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/02/beyoncefan666-twitter-account-predicting-future-beyonce-pregnancy\"><strong>strategy</strong></a>. Most attempts to peek into the future seem silly when that future rolls around. Look no farther than shouting human eggplant <a href=\"http://www.avclub.com/article/trumps-new-press-secretary-five-year-running-feud--248859\"><strong>Sean Spicer’s</strong></a> least favorite franchise: Dippin’ Dots. The theme park staple calls itself “The Ice Cream of the Future™” because it is frozen using liquid nitrogen instead of a conventional freezer. The Dippin’ Dots brand is built on a particular idea of futurity –– a future where cryogenic freezing (using liquid nitrogen to preserve the body for later resuscitation) is serious proposition and the robot that run our lives are pastel upgrades of C3PO-inspired droids (Dippin’ Dots calls its freezing mechanism the DotBot3000). Of course, Dippin’ Dots’ branding was tongue in cheek, but not enough to sustain the public’s interest. When Dippin’ Dots filed for bankruptcy in 2011, Business Insider wrote an <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/dippin-dots-bankruptcy-ice-cream-future-2011-11\"><strong>article</strong></a> called “Why Dippin' Dots Were Not The Ice Cream Of The Future” which ultimately concluded that the company relies on novelty, and “it's hard to do that after 23 years.”</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nonetheless, some forward-thinking snapshots charm us even beyond the nostalgia of how backward they ultimately prove to be. Orwell’s 1984, Vannevar Bush’s <a href=\"http://history-computer.com/Internet/Dreamers/Bush.html\"><em><strong>Memex</strong></em></a>, –– their appeal isn’t predicated on the accuracy of their predictions. The same can be said for Suzanne Ciani, the lanky pioneer of the Buchla Analog Modular Synthesizer, who first appeared in mainstream music consciousness in 1974, when Helen Epstein profiled her in a <em>The New York Time</em>s article called “The Cello Can’t Play These Chords.” Ciani later became one of the major names of the modular-synth and New Age avant-gardes, but she began her career with a small time sound design company called Ciani/Musica. Ciani/Musica partnered with major corporations like Merrill Lynch, AT&T, General Electric and, most famously, Coca-Cola to write the musical and sound effect scores for their commercials. Many of the companies had trouble recording real-life sounds that came alive on tape, Ciani helped them out with her synth. Her most successful sound was a space-age-y take on the ‘pop’ of a coke bottle and the sound of soda pouring into a glass. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The clips below are a handful of those sounds that launched Ciani’s career (and a few that didn’t), and they’re laden with the pseudo-futuristic bleeps and bloops that set off Letterman’s (see #2) loveable snark (some aren’t), but all are still charming even forty years into the future.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. In 1977, Suzanne Ciani produced the sound effects for Meco’s album <em>Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk</em>, a disco album using the soundtrack from Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, which had dropped earlier that year. The album went platinum.

In 1980, Ciani was invited on the <em>The David Letterman Show</em> (that was his morning pre-cursor to <em>Late Night)</em> to show off an analog synthesizer called the “Prophet 5,” then the cutting edge of electronic sounds.

Suzanne Ciani’s work on the Xenon Pinball Machine inspired in Omni Magazine precisely that Dippin’ Dots brand of misguided futurism. The video opens on the host seated next to a transparent orb, occasionally electrified by a purple lightning native to Halloween decor. Without addressing the orb, the host asks with deadpan nonsequitur, “Isn’t it amazing that electricity like this, could one day be used to re-grow entire limbs?” before coming around to introduce Ciani. Ciani explains how she designed the sound effects and music of the Xenon Pinball game. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><u><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM4YAio2LM4\"><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/sM4YAio2LM4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></a></u></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4.

Many major brands have “sound logos” –– familiar six or seven second jingles that trigger in listeners a kind of Proustian brand loyalty: the “restart” sound of Apple computers. The hum of THX productions. The ding of an iPhone text. Suzanne Ciani was responsible for some of the most culturally prominent of these sounds in the 1980’s and ‘90s. Here’s her take on the  Columbia Pictures sound logo: </p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CchYT2lUR6o\"><u><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/CchYT2lUR6o\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></u></a>.</p><p><br></p><p>8.

		"title" : "An Interview with Arthur Sze",
		"slug" : "interview-arthur-sze",
		"body" : "<p><em>(Arthur Sze’s ninth book of poetry, Compass Rose (Copper Canyon, 2014), was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. A new collection, Sight Lines, will be published by Copper Canyon in February 2019.</em><em> His poem \"Dawn Redwood\" is included in the Harvard Advocate's upcoming </em>Cell<em> issue.)</em></p><p><em><br></em></p><p>EE— \tFirst of all — thank you so much for taking the time to meet! We at the Advocate are huge fans of your work and incredibly excited to be publishing “Dawn Redwood” in <em>Cell</em>. </p><p>\tIn reading your poems, something that’s really struck me is their sort of contemplative traveling energy — reading them we transit through their images, say, from a landscape into the cells of a tree into the cosmic scale of stars. Are your poems driven by memory, by research, by invention — what would you say is the driving thread connecting the images of your poems?</p><p><br></p><p>AS— \tThat’s one of the mysteries of art, and I’m not sure I can be the best articulator of it! But I can say that my work has to do with <i>braiding</i>, and with exploring what’s happening in different spaces, allowing the imagination to jump or move, in a way that isn’t linear but still convergent, so that the disparate worlds going on are braiding different narratives or lines of exploration, influencing and affecting each other. So the process of creation is very different from that of a narrative poem, where you might have a more linear sort of causality running through — I’m more interested in a kind of simultaneity. It’s an intuitive process, developing those lines of memory; I like to think that memory and desire make up the axis that runs through my work.</p><p><br></p><p>EE— \tAt the Advocate, when we are publishing poems, we often find ourselves arguing about the importance of aesthetic beauty versus the ideas of a poem. I see your work drawing imagistic threads and thoughts very elegantly into the reader’s sight and then leaving them there for us to connect — do you think it’s productive for a reader to try to track down capital-I Ideas in one of your poems, to press it for what it’s <i>really</i> saying? How should we be thinking about it once we have read it?</p><p><br></p><p>AS—\t I think it’s an endless question. It’s a question of priority, and whether you can prioritize the elegance of language, or the idea or urgency behind the poem; I’m most interested in the tension between the two. Unlike a math equation where there’s a correct answer, in poetry it has more to do with reconciling those forces which can appear to be antithetical; if a poem’s successful, it resolves them in an interesting way. So I think I want that urgency first, and I also want that elegance of language, and elegance of language in itself isn’t enough, but urgency that’s just a sort of raw spouting isn’t satisfactory either. So the process of creating a poem is to strike a kind of balance, and I don’t think it’s fixed. I want to propose that these forces move through the poem, and they need to balance each other for the poem to be successful. </p><p><br></p><p>EE—\tIn workshop Jorie Graham tells us that if we sit down knowing what we want to write about, and get up having written that exact poem, we are doing it wrong — that a poem has to change and respond to itself as it’s written. As a poet, do you find this to be the case? Or do you ever end up writing exactly what you intended to?</p><p><br></p><p>AS—\tI’m in agreement with Jorie about this. I’ll phrase it a little differently — if I as a poet know what I’m going to write about, and I have the end in mind or in sight, I can do that, but in my experience those don’t turn out to be very satisfactory poems. And part of the difficulty, I think, is that there isn’t enough room for discovery. So I like the idea that you might set out with that intention in mind knowing that you can jettison it, that it’s just the thing to get you started. But if you are just writing the poem you have in mind and you complete it, it’s very hard to have a deep sense of surprise, and to honor the process of discovery which is so important to a poem. One of the things I like about Jorie’s poetry is its sense of the mind in the process of discovery. Then it’s very clear that the process is integral to the product, to the end poem, because the poem is tracking the movement of the imagination and the movement of the mind in a way that couldn’t be foreseen.</p><p>\tI do want to say that sometimes you can write a poem with a kind of emotional pressure behind it. I’m thinking of “Dawn Redwood” — I didn’t know what the poem would be about, but C.D. Wright was a very good friend of mine. We’d known each other for I think about thirty years. So her death was a great shock and loss and surprise when I heard about it. I knew I wanted to write something about her, but I didn’t know what shape it would take. And then when I started to think in terms of memory, I remembered the next-to-last time I saw her, when we walked through a cemetery — and that’s in the poem. So I just wanted to give a general idea of the approach: instead of saying “I know what the poem is going to be about,” and writing it out, which isn’t very satisfying, you can take an emotional pressure and say “I know I’m going to write something about, vaguely, this person or situation or feeling of loss”, and then see what happens. And for me, fragments, phrases, images, snippets of speech, those are like the sparks or seeds for the poem.</p><p><br></p><p>EE—\tAbsolutely — just as memory and desire make up the connecting thread! I want to ask just a little more about the poem “Dawn Redwood”, and in particular about that lovely difficult last line, “the scratched words return to their sleeves”. Some of us thought it was talking about a vinyl record, some of us thought it was about words carved into slowly-healing tree bark…</p><p><br></p><p>AS—\tI love poems that are rich in ambiguity, and I think both of those readings are fine, in terms of the last line —although they’re different, that doesn’t mean you have to select one reading over another. It’s from a poem of C.D.’s called “Floating Trees”, and that’s always interested me, the idea of a tree that can float, and of course the dawn redwood is one of the earliest trees. I like the idea of a vinyl record slipped back into its casing, but I also thought of it like this: the words and the language that she’s written somehow change after she’s died, that the speaker of the poem somehow gets the sense that in the poems she’s written, “the words return to their sleeves”…they’ve returned to some sort of hiding or resting position, waiting to come out again. It’s not as though they’ve been lost, but they’re going through some sort of dormancy, a sense of being<i> aside </i>somehow in a space.</p><p><br></p><p>EE—\tWow—we hadn’t thought of that, but it makes perfect sense!</p><p><br></p><p>AS—\tI’m going to quote a Misty School poet Gu Cheng — he once told me, “Arthur, sometimes the poem needs to be a little smarter than the poet writing it.” And I’ve always liked that comment, because again, it has to do with a sense of discovery and immersion, of discovering something in the process of writing it that one couldn’t have foreseen, and to me that’s one of the thrills of writing —“oh, why didn’t I see that” or “why didn’t I experience that”, but I couldn’t have done that until I started writing. You have to stay open, to resist knowing where you’re going too soon. I think too often young poets want to get to what the end is, or what appears to be in sight, but actually over time you learn to resist that; resisting it allows the opportunity for unforeseen things to come into the poem, and those are so important. So, for me, I can talk process — I had four or five different lines of C.D. Wright’s that were in that position of the poem’s last thought — and I had a phrase that was something like “I made do with things that came my way”, which was from another poem of hers, “The Box This Comes In”. But that didn’t feel right, and I had another line, and that didn’t feel right, so I was just thumbing through her different books, and that phrase leapt out at me. So I thought: I don’t quite understand it, but it’s rich in implications, it’s got a kind of mystery, and again, I liked the sense of concealment and revelation, and it just felt right to make that the end of the poem. </p><p><br></p><p>EE—\tYou mentioned the process of young poets—what advice would you give a young poet starting out? </p><p><br></p><p>AS—\tThe most important thing is to keep writing! To not stop writing. Years and years ago I sat in on a workshop with Lilly Hellman, the playwright, she had a class at Berkeley — and I could never write fiction, but was interested in what she had to say, so I sat in on the classes. And I remember sitting in her office one day, and she said to me, “Arthur, I don’t know a damn thing about poetry, but I can give you one piece of advice: write, write, write. Don’t stop writing.” Because if you stop for even six months, it’s like losing the muscles and the control of language that you need to master. That’s my first piece of advice. </p><p>\tMy other one is to not think too much about what the current trends are, about what’s popular, what’s in vogue. Particularly in graduate school, you can see younger poets pick up the style of the poet they’re studying with, which is not their actual style; it’s just the stage at which they’ve learnt someone else’s style. I think the important thing is Rilke’s advice, which is to go back deep into yourself and ask: is this work sprung from necessity? Because that’s really crucial, that sense of language coming from a really powerful, deep place inside of you. And to know that it’s going to be years of struggle.</p><p><br></p><p>EE—\tSo when are you satisfied with something you’ve written, and when should we be satisfied with something we’ve put on the page?</p><p><br></p><p>AS—\tAgain, it’s an endless question. Valery said that he never finished a poem — he just abandoned them. My own process is much slower now than when I was your age. When I was a student at Berkeley I’d finish a poem and say to myself, “It’s done, I can send it out!” But now I finish a poem and I say, “I have no idea if it’s any good or not,” and I need to put it aside for a couple of months and see what happens. Then I’ll come back and look at it, and realize that a line is wrong or a phrase is wrong or I need to change something. When I was young I was maybe too hurried to say something was done and move on to the next thing — but that’s an illusion. Over time I’ve learnt not to trust that judgment; to err on the side of not doing anything, which is very difficult. So this is the perspective of sitting on something and not acting—that resting period is also a part of the gestation process, and you can make more changes to the poem, and put it away, let it rest, get back to it…ultimately I do get to a position where I feel that, if I keep working on the poem, I’m going to make it worse — I can feel that it’s getting away from me. I often feel that I tend to write <i>beyond</i> where the final poem is, which I can’t see. I put in phrases and realize, instinctively, that they are damaging or weakening the poem, or getting too far from the essential impulse—and then I’ll put it aside and backtrack, so my other advice is to <i>save your drafts</i>, so you can go back and trace the turns you’ve made.</p><p><br></p><p>EE—\tRight!</p><p><br></p><p>AS—\tAnd at times I’ve thought a poem was done and showed it to one or two trusted readers, and end up saying to myself “Why didn’t I see this?” And in that case I also say to myself — well, I <i>could </i>have kept it in the drawer for another three months, but that amount of time wouldn’t have mattered — I wouldn’t have seen it, but the moment someone did, I could see right away what needed work. So it’s not just putting something aside for an amount of time, either—that’s no guarantee that you’ll come back and make the work better.</p><p><br></p><p>EE—\tAlso — I myself study Chinese classical poetry, and I recall reading that you translate classical Chinese poetry in addition to your own poems! I was wondering whether you find that your own work draws from the Chinese classics as well. As a reader I almost see a similar treatment of the nature-image — these elegant discrete images paralleling each other — in your work and, for instance, the landscape poems of Wang Wei. </p><p><br></p><p>AS—\tI think it’s both an intentional and intuitive process. I can say that in earlier days I turned to translation as a means of learning my craft — I didn’t go to graduate school. When I was at UC Berkeley I immersed myself in Tang Dynasty poetry. My early translations came out of wanting to translate, but also wanting to explore language and selfishly think about what I could learn from them as poets. But I was also dissatisfied with the translations available in English at the time, and thought I might as well try my own. At the time I saw the poets as models to learn from — but today, Tang poetry seems claustrophobic to me. How many times can you read a Li Bai poem, and have moonlight, and wine, and rivers, and the constriction of vocabulary…that constriction can create a sort of power, but it can also be limiting. So in my own evolution I worked with the Tang Dynasty poets, but I also wanted to look at poets of other eras — Tao Qian, and Wen Yiduo in the the twentieth century. I particularly liked working with Wen Yiduo because he knew that classical tradition, but he broke it apart. He was writing in vernacular, of course. And his nine-character line really interests me. It has a kind of architectural decorum but also there’s a kind of rhythmical loosening that happens that interests me.</p><p>\tSo I know Chinese poetry well, I’ve drawn from it, but I’ve also wanted to break from it as well. I got to the stage where the sources that I <i>haven’t</i> translated have become more important to me: the <i>Zhuangzi</i>, the Daoist text, or Qu Yuan’s <i>Tianwen</i>, the “Questions Regarding Heaven”. Or even the <i>Yi Ching</i>. And those aren’t works I think I could translate — I wouldn’t be happy with what I came up with. But today those are works that are more inspirational to me than the Tang poems. But the Tang poems were really valuable as a stage. And — can I tell a parable?</p><p><br></p><p>EE—\tPlease do!</p><p><br></p><p>AS—\tWhen I taught at the Institute of American Indian Arts I used to tell my students a story that has to do with Japanese tea ceremonies. A merchant wants to impress Rikyu — the man who coalesced all the key elements of the tea ceremony — with his good taste, so he spends a small fortune buying a tea bowl. He asks Rikyu to do a tea ceremony with it, and so he does, and at the end the merchant says, “Well, how was it?” He’s hoping that Rikyu will compliment him on his good taste, but instead Rikyu says, “It was okay, I wasn’t that interested.” And the moment Rikyu leaves, the merchant takes that bowl and he throws it on the floor and shatters it, he’s so pissed that it didn’t have the effect that he wanted—I like to think of that bowl as a metaphor for a poem. Now, his friend is aghast, and gathers up the shards, and glues them together, and puts it on a shelf. And years later Rikyu comes back and picks up this bowl and says “This is the most fantastic tea bowl I’ve seen. Who made it?” Well, if you think of who made it: there’s the original potter; there’s the merchant who buys it, who tries to impress Rikyu, who throws and breaks it apart; Rikyu is a part of the creation of the new pot, since his lack of interest in the first one led to that breaking-apart; and then the friend who glues it back together is also a maker. And the new bowl, irregular and poorly shaped, is beyond the control of any one individual, but all of those steps were necessary to create that really great tea bowl. </p><p>\tSo I like to think of that as a metaphor for how, when you’re a young poet, that bowl is the conception of a poem that you’re striving for. And maybe having the whole poem in mind, knowing just what you’re striving for: that’s the first bowl. And you shouldn’t necessarily negate that; you might want to pursue it, and you might want to experiment with breaking it apart. Breaking it apart might be flipping the ends and the beginnings, changing the form of the poem, putting it into one-line stanzas, taking apart phrases and reassembling them, and asking yourself what is the beginning and what’s the ending. Then the final poem can have shards of the original intention and vision, but it’s quite different.</p><p><br></p><p>EE—\tThat’s a really useful way of thinking of it! I was wondering, also: Chinese poetry in particular is a tremendously deep cultural heritage that the modern English-language reader doesn’t have much access to. What starting point would you recommend to the English-language reader?</p><p><br></p><p>AS—\tDo you know François Cheng’s <i>Chinese Poetic Writing</i>? I like to send American readers there first; I think it’s recently been reissued. He’s Chinese, born in Shanghai but grew up in Paris, and he’s very influenced by semiotics, systems of language and signs. The first half of the book is a series of essays that combine discussion of Chinese poetry with Chinese painting and music, and his reading of the space inside of some Chinese characters is revelatory. The essays are so provocative — they open a lot of windows for an American reader to see into. </p><p><br></p><p>EE—\tRight! It seems to me that when talking about English poetry we talk a lot about ambiguity and implication and the sort of hidden valences that echo in a word or line without being fully stated. I’ve always wondered how to address that in Chinese poems. </p><p><br></p><p>AS—\tRight. Translation’s an impossible task. But one of the fun things is navigating the different choices one has to make. I think François Cheng is really great at looking at the space in the characters. So there’s a poem by Liu Changqing and it says: “芳草閉閑門”, or “Fragrant grasses block the idle gate”. And he shows that “閉閑門”, “block the idle gate”, has the door radical, “門”, three times. The first one contains the character “才”, “talents”, and the next has “木”, “tree”, and then there’s nothing in the third one. And his reading is: the third one with nothing in that empty space is really saying <i>empty yourself</i>, or let go of your attachment to your own talents, and your attachment to material things. And so when the speaker wants to step from the door to meet his Zen teacher, he has to physically cross the threshold, but he also has to empty himself of these material attachments. I mean—how can you translate that?</p><p><br></p><p>EE— \tYou can’t!</p><p><br></p><p>AS— \tYou can’t. So that’s why his essays, I think, are really valuable; because they give a glimpse of the different layers of a poem, that, for an English reader, can be mindboggling. </p><p><br></p><p>EE—\tI’ll have to look that up! I have just two more quick questions: could you tell us what you’re going to read here at Harvard later, and could you tell us what you are working on right now?</p><p><br></p><p>AS—\t I’m going to read a selection from three different books later this afternoon: a good selection from Compass Rose; I’m going to read the title poem of my previous book, The Ginkgo Light, and then I’m going to read new poems. So I may actually change as I go this afternoon — but I’m thinking roughly half of my reading will be new work. I’ve recently completed a new book called Sightlines, and that’ll come out in early 2019 from Copper Canyon. That book has an unusual structure to it: it has six <i>dimensional lines</i> that run through the text. So instead of section dividers, there’s a poem, and then there’s a one-line poem and it’s all white space. And then other poems, and another one-liner, and so on. And those one-liners are on the one hand like one-line haiku, or like flash; they also disrupt the motion of the poem-to-poem movement, and they create a tension but also a non-sequitur of disorientation. So, you know, I’m not going to be the most popular poet in terms of book sales, but it interests me how much disorientation or suspension one can have before there’s a kind of convergence or revelation. So in this new book the six one-liners that appear to have little to do with the poems going on around them, other than disrupt the flow and introduce a different kind of dimensionality: all of those six lines come back in the next-to-last poem, which is called “Sightlines”. And it couldn’t be the last poem — but it needed to be the next-to-last poem, so that there is this convergence. Then there’s a long poem that ends the book that I’ll probably read this afternoon. </p><p>\tSo that’s what I’ve just finished, and I’m still fine-tuning phrases here and there; it’s still too early for me to think about what the next book’s going to be like, but I have written a few poems that have come to me as well.</p>",

Pitchfork praises the release as “some of the heaviest and most infectious sounds around,” going as far as to say, “This album is critical listening for everyone.” A Tribe Called Red will be performing at The Sinclair on Saturday, March 18.</em></p><p>JK: I’d love to start by talking about the intersection of art and politics. Do you see yourself primarily as an activist? As an artist? Do you think the two are fundamentally tied together?</p><p>BW: They can be for sure. In my case personally, I don’t really see myself as an activist. I see myself as indigenous. The activism isn’t really a choice for an indigenous person. It’s a part of life.</p><p>JK: Is it irritating that the public perception of your art can be connected to your heritage and political causes that you haven’t necessarily chosen? Or does it feel like an honor to be part of that tradition?</p><p>BW: It’s a responsibility really. People who use our culture and our art have to be responsible to that history. Being responsible to that history means speaking about indigenous issues and bringing light to things that don’t get enough attention.</p><p>JK: Over the span of your career, have you seen a shift in how much attention indigenous art and indigenous issues are receiving?</p><p>BW: Definitely. There’s been a huge shift.  </p><p>JK: When did you first notice that?</p><p>BW: I don’t know to be honest. It’s really been a change that’s happened over the past decade where people outside of indigenous communities have become interested in what’s going on. We come from a long history of amazing indigenous artists. We didn’t just pop up out of a vacuum. But in previous times, non-indigenous peoples just didn’t have much interest in interacting with indigenous issues or indigenous art.</p><p>JK: How do you see yourself in relation to that tradition of indigenous art? Do you see A Tribe Called Red as a new era? Do you see yourself as carrying a torch? Do you think it’s somewhere in between?</p><p>BW: Yea it’s definitely all those things. We talk about using our culture in our work—that’s our history. Our culture isn’t just one thing—it’s a holistic culture. It’s our spirituality, it’s our history, it’s our knowledge of self, it’s our knowledge of future. It’s all these things wrapped up into one. It’s the same as with the activism thing, where you’re not just ever going to be an activist, you’re going to be all of those things. It’s necessary.</p><p>JK: Do you have ideas about what might be causing people outside indigenous communities to pay more attention to indigenous art?</p><p>BW: To be honest, I don’t know what created that change. There just seems to be an interest where there wasn’t before. In the past, most indigenous art stayed in the community. There wasn’t an interest outside of the community, but there was an interest and a need within the community. I think what we’re seeing now, not just with indigenous people but with any marginalized people across the board is that when you lose your voice, it’s the artists who usually find that voice again first. It’s within the arts where it becomes safe to do that. Within the arts, you can cross a lot of barriers with who hears what you have to say. We’re finding that tenfold with music, where we reach audiences that we would never be able to reach if we were just activists. When you start to think about the power that there is in that, in finding your voice through the arts, you start to understand why there’s an interest now. There’s something being said. There’s something being done. It’s not just opulent artwork. It’s not just pretty things. There’s a general interest in the world now to not just look at pretty things, because there are all these things that need to be discussed. People are now interested in interacting with those issues beyond just the communities that are affected. Again, I don’t know what caused that, but I’m seeing it more and more.</p><p>JK: Do you also feel connected to the broader history of marginalized people using music as a force to shift that power balance?</p><p>BW: Definitely. Myself, I come from an artist family. The performance culture in my family started four generations ago on Coney Island when my family was part of a sideshow. My grandmother remembers my great-grandfather singing made-up songs and being on display for tourists as a way to help feed the family. So growing out of that place of necessity, my family became actors and performers. Through that culture, I grew up in the theater culture of Toronto. In the mid 80s, when the second wave of people started escaping Chile, we had those people come and live with us. We were first stop for a lot of refugees, and we became really involved with the Chilean community. That’s when I first realized the power of music to carry a message beyond what you could do otherwise. It was when I was talking to these people who were politically involved in Chile as musicians. They just sang songs. But they were imprisoned and held and tortured for years just for singing songs. I remember that blowing my mind at a really young age—the idea that someone could see a singer as so dangerous that they would need to throw them in jail and torture them.</p><p>JK: So did you originally approach music as an avenue for social change?</p><p>BW: No that came afterwards. It sounds funny after what I just said, but music was actually a way to get away from the political culture of my family. When I was a teenager, I just wanted to get away from all of the heaviness of politics and activism within my family. I just wanted to dance. That’s what music was for me—it was an escape. When I was a teenager and in my early 20s, I was heavily involved with rave culture. Within the rave movement I realized, here are all these young people who are having these amazing group experiences and really empathizing with each other. But there wasn’t a real message to it. We were just there doing it because it was something we felt we needed to do. I’ve been DJing now for over 20 years, and at some point I just realized that we could take that opportunity and fill it with a message. In that wanting to escape from all the politics and stuff, I realized that I had found the perfect vehicle for my ideas.</p><p>JK: But at the beginning, you did find that music was an escape and an effective release from that social tension?</p><p>BW: Definitely. And it’s interesting now to watch our shows, because now we do have this very solid political message to our music, and people who share those views and those feelings come to our shows for a release. All these people with all these frustrations, fears, and anxieties about what’s going on in the world are coming to our shows not to protest, not as an act of activism, but as a release from that activism in a safe place. Our whole thing was creating a space for indigenous people within the urban landscape to gather, because we didn’t have those spaces in Ottawa. But when we created a safe space for indigenous people to gather in the city, everyone said, ‘Hey, this is a safe space. Let’s go check it out.’ So we ended up creating a safe space for everybody.</p><p>JK: I read an interview where you talked about how your original mission was just to throw a party, but then throwing a party as indigenous people turned out to be a kind of political act in itself.</p><p>BW: Yeah, well just doing anything as indigenous people becomes political. My mother raised me with the idea that every act that you do from when you wake up in the morning is political, because everything in this world tried to stop you from being here. So the fact that I’m alive today is a political act. That’s why I don’t see myself as an activist. This is just my life.</p><p>JK: Has your role changed because of the current political climate? I could see someone who grew up with the understanding that all of his actions were inherently political being less surprised by the hostility that has come to define politics. Do recent political events like the progress with the Dakota Access Pipeline feel like a change for you or a continuation of something that was already there?</p><p>BW: Well yea for me personally it’s definitely feels like a continuation. It’s the same as it ever was. We’ve survived worse, and we’ll continue to survive. If anything, our role has become more important even though it’s not something different. Because again, I don’t like to call us activists because our main goal is the party. It’s the release. It’s creating that safe space for people to let go of that stress and that anger and that fear. So if we start changing our role, and we try to become part of the movement in a more direct way, that changes our position. Our place is really to create a safe space for everyone.</p><p>JK: Do you feel less inclined to speak very publicly about certain issues because your main goal is to create a space where people can step away from that? Or do you feel like taking public positions is a part of creating that safe space?</p><p>BW: Yea I mean there are definitely things that we’ll always talk about very publicly. It’s just—I don’t know how to put it—I guess there’s a general message more than a specific message. Personally, I’m really careful with the things that I talk about and the things that I put out there in the world because I am trying to make something that doesn’t divide people. So when I come across issues that I find particularly divisive within my community, I try to stay away from them, because I don’t want to alienate any of those people. I’m not here to take any of those kind of sub-sides. I’m here to create that safe space, and creating that space does often mean speaking out and standing up for things. It just doesn’t mean being on the front line fighting all our time. That’s not our place. Our place is again to create the space and to be the release.</p><p>JK: And that has been pretty consistent since the start of A Tribe Called Red? It’s always been a place for people to step away right?</p><p>BW: Yes. And also a step into. It depends who you’re talking to. When you think about non-indigenous people, we’re also here to confront people with certain ideas. We use that safe place and that release to hit people with a visual that makes them think about things differently when it comes to indigenous identity.</p><p>JK: So have you seen yourself connect with more non-indigenous people recently? How has that relationship been over time?</p><p>BW: That was the huge surprise to us really. In the early days, when we started this just as a party, we just aimed our advertisement toward the indigenous community and saw a predominantly indigenous audience. But that changed really quickly.</p><p>JK: What do you think made non-indigenous people feel comfortable stepping in? Was it something about your approach?</p><p>BW: Perhaps. Electronic music has quickly become super commercial and grown into the popular music of the decade. Since we were remixing our traditional music with something that was so popular like dub-step, it got the attention of people who would have never interacted with indigenous culture otherwise. But we didn’t expect that. That was a huge surprise to us because of the history of people not being interested or interacting with indigenous culture.</p><p>JK: More just purely musically, do you have any directions that you would like to push your music in? Are there any new genres you intend to explore?</p><p>BW: At the moment, we don’t have specific plans, but this last album was a huge step out of our comfort zone. That was the goal of <i>We Are the Halluci Nation</i>. We wanted to create something that wasn’t just dance music, and that wasn’t just a club album. We wanted to make something that had more to it—more of a story. We wanted to create a concept album that had emotional movement.</p><p>JK: Has that been really well received by your listeners?</p><p>BW: Definitely. People have been willing to take the journey with us, and they’re really picking up what we were trying to say on the album.</p><p>JK: I’m really glad to hear that. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me. A Tribe Called Red has opened my eyes to a range of ideas I might have otherwise missed, so thank you for that.</p><p>BW: Well thank you.</p><p>JK: I’m looking forward to your show at the Sinclair. Thanks again for your time.</p><p>BW: No problem. Have a good one.</p>",

		"body" : "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Our favorite artists are human. I’ve always questioned the accessibility of Romantic poets. I’ve always been hesitant in the faces of vast catalogues, of established names, of Enlightenment reactionaries, the free-roaming, the supernaturally-inclined, the metaphysical, the intensely personal. Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, Byron, Blake— skimming the tops of these collections in my AP Literature course had always had the adverse effect of revealing just how much there was left to know. When it comes down to it, William Wordsworth owned a copy of Paradise Lost bound in the skin of his pet dog, Pepper. No one is perfect.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>2. We don’t walk nearly enough. According to hosts of concerned locals, Wordsworth often composed his poems while pacing back and forth over the high mountain trails and lovely cobblestone streets of Cumbria. If you’re looking to spearhead the next great return to Romantic verse or the next great American novel, try getting mobile.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>3. Family makes a person. Wordsworth’s fair copy manuscripts were never done in his own hand. His penmanship was— put simply— absolutely terrible, so he tasked his sister Dorothy, his wife Mary, and his daughter Dora with the transcription of all of his greatest works. Each new manuscript usually took them upwards of a few months to complete; as a family unit, they needed to be invariably close.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>4. There is always more to love than necessity. Before accepting William Wordsworth’s marriage proposal, Mary Wordsworth was rumored to have been courted by Samuel Taylor Coleridge for quite some time. One can only imagine how uncomfortable this must have been, given that they all lived under the same roof. Still, it makes for an interesting testament to romance and friendship in an era where women’s primary roles were unfairly reduced to and typified as homemaking.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>5. Empathizing with far-removed times and people inspires awe. I had tea and toast in Dove Cottage, read magazines by the bay window in Rydal Mount—I even played John Ruskin’s piano and threw breadcrumbs to the blackbirds under the archway of Beatrix Potter’s garden. It had me wanting to live their respective realities, too: I climbed to the top of Helm Crag, was buffeted by wind among the Lion and the Lamb, waded into Easedale Tarn, got rained out of Silver Howe, and frequented every tea room, bookstore, and pub from Grasmere to Ambleside and north again to Keswick. It might’ve even been more fun in this century than in the 1800s.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>6. Change is as much a constant in place as it is in people. The time of day, the angle of the sun, the density of the mist, the intensity of the rain, the height of the rivers, the power of the waterfalls, the smells in the shop windows, the colors in the streets— Cumbria never looked even remotely the same in our day-to-day experience of it, and that’s an exciting mindset to hold onto, even if Cambridge, Massachusetts doesn’t seem so immediately dynamic. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>7. Loss is productive. The memorialization of John Wordsworth is often cited as the driving force behind his brother’s poetic development. In parallel, William’s imagination and perceptions of him are the basis of what scholars now understand about both John Wordsworth’s life and passing. Considering how much Romantic poetry is written in elegiac verse, there is just as much to be gathered from life’s last moments as any others, and the creative process can offer catharsis or stability to some.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>8. Put it down on paper. Write a letter. Make your edits in pen or pencil. Wordsworth wrote the first lines of his poem “Michael” between the existing lines of a printed book of poems by Coleridge. You don’t have to be such a jerk about it, maybe, but tangible pieces of writing accrue so much undeniable value over time. There are entire trusts, museums, and galleries dedicated to the preservation, maintenance, and historical importance of manuscripts. When your computer hard drive is wiped, what’s left?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>9. The idea of the self is excitingly new. Autobiography in English lyric verse did not exist before the Romantics, and before Wordsworth’s <i>Prelude</i> more specifically. Imagine not having a set language for creative self expression—entire intellectualized movements of subjectivity in art might’ve never existed.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>10. You can replace most of your major meals with scones. Cheese scones with smoked salmon and cream cheese are the savory alternative to scones with clotted cream and jam, but you can also just have both.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Lion and the Lamb at the summit of Helm Crag<br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span></span><img src=\"/media/tmp/IMG_4104_UeDqRVl.JPG\" width=\"547\" height=\"410\" style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; width: 547px; height: 410px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dove Cottage, where Wordsworth lived</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/IMG_4107_2Bv78pQ.JPG\" width=\"544\" height=\"681\" style=\"width: 544px; height: 681px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The trail following River Rothay up to Easedale Tarn<br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/IMG_4111.JPG\" width=\"541\" height=\"675\" style=\"width: 541px; height: 675px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the ridges near Easedale Tarn</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/IMG_4117_toVkO85.JPG\" width=\"539\" height=\"691\" style=\"width: 539px; height: 691px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Side street in Grasmere</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/IMG_4123_xtFAW8T.JPG\" width=\"530\" height=\"666\" style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; width: 530px; height: 666px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Scones from Baldry's</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/Screen%20Shot%202017-03-25%20at%201.35.54%20PM.png\" width=\"529\" height=\"408\" style=\"width: 529px; height: 408px;\"></p>",

Smith, the producer; writer; singer and all-round artistic force of <a href=\"https://eskimeaux.bandcamp.com/\"><u>Eskimeaux</u></a> takes a moment to pause on 21 South Street. Smith is known for the quiet intimacy of songs that grow to a growl; her projects “O.K” and the 2016 “Year of the Rabbit” cross from tender revelations “i admit i'm scared” into accusation: “I say, \"i love you\" just to get you to say anything.”</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On<a href=\"http://www.axs.com/events/329377/whyy-tickets\"><u> April 14th, </u></a>Smith brings her lyrical, gritty sound to the Sinclair. By the time she comes to Boston, Eskimeaux will have completed a cross-country odyssey in the company of alt-rock band WHY? Today she talks with the blog about spices, guitar strings, and sonic inspiration.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><br></em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>You</em><em>’</em><em>re touring with </em><em>“</em><em>Why?</em><em>”</em><em>; you</em><em>’</em><em>ve worked with </em><em>“</em><em>Japanese Breakfast;</em><em>” “</em><em>Slutever</em><em>” </em><em>and others; what</em><em>’</em><em>s it like to work with different artists?</em><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It’s great! Working with different artists always gives me new perspective on how something can be played, how a song can be structured, what kinds of sounds I like but have never used for some reason, etc. For example, when Japanese Breakfast and I toured together, Michelle taught me a few of her songs. Having a new, intimate understanding of how she thinks about harmony was super inspiring for me when I got home and started writing new material.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>What do you look forward to the most, on this tour?</em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">WHY? has been one of my favorite bands for a long time now. I have a distinct memory of sitting in my friend Sophie’s childhood bedroom in 2005 learning to put on eyeliner, playing with her cat, and listening to “Gemini Birthday Song” on repeat. It was playing from someone’s MySpace account. They’ve informed ways I’ve approached arrangement, production, and lyrics in my own writing. So, I guess the thing I’m looking forward to most is getting to see them play every night and just reveling in the experience!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><br></em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>In past interviews, you</em><em>’</em><em>ve talked about the name </em><em>“</em><em>Eskimeaux</em><em>” </em><em>arising from your T</em><em>’</em><em>lingit heritage. Animals and natural imagery float throughout your music - there</em><em>’</em><em>s </em><em>“</em><em>Two Mountains;</em><em>” “</em><em>Sparrow; </em><em>“</em><em>Sleeping Bear,</em><em>” </em><em>and of course, </em><em>“</em><em>Year of the Rabbit.</em><em>” </em><em>Does the imagery hold particular significance to you?</em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a kid growing up in downtown Manhattan, the closest thing I had to nature during the school year was Washington Square Park, which isn’t much. In the Summer my parents sent me to all kinds of summer camps - when I was little I went to day camp, when I got a little older I went to a sleep away camp. I found out there that I had a deep love for the woods and animals, especially for horses. I think natural imagery is a universal way to express every possible emotion. For example, the simple image of a mountain can evoke such a wide spectrum of emotions from peace and strength,  to wildness and mistrust, to looming omnipotence so quickly and vividly depending on the context. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>“</em><em>Year of the Rabbit</em><em>” </em><em>has a softer, hazier sound; the name definitely invokes some nostalgia. Do you view your albums as capturing moments in time?</em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Definitely. The songs on “Year of the Rabbit” feel like they’re attempting to part the murky curtains of time to examine the roots of a long-term relationship to try to find the cracks. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><br></em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>You</em><em>’</em><em>ve got one hand to count on. Who are your primary influences, and how do they affect your work?</em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I’m going to focus this to an artist + album because this can get out of hand really quickly!</p><p>Peanut butter - It kept me alive in 2008.<br>Blundstone Boots - My pair are one of my horcruxes.<br>Ginger - I was a very picky eater when I was a kid. Then I discovered ginger and it expanded my palate in a wild way.<br>Insoles - I have a million dollar idea involving in-soles...that’s all I can say.<br>Nylon guitar strings - can’t live without them! They make every song 100% more beautiful.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><br></em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>“</em><em>O.K.</em><em>” </em><em>and </em><em>“</em><em>Rabbit</em><em>” </em><em>have markedly different sounds. How do you transition between projects?</em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em></em>It’s kind of just...whatever I’m feeling at the time. “O.K.” was written and recorded over a long period of time so I worked hard to make each moment precious and detailed. “Year of the Rabbit” was written and recorded relatively quickly, so it was more important to me to create a less detailed, more impressionistic record.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Do you have any advice - or thoughts - for students and young artists starting to put out their own music? </em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ira Glass said something that has been really important to me over the years. He said, “Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.” In short, don’t be afraid to experiment and fall short of your own expectations. Just keep trying and let yourself be as weird or not weird as you’re feeling!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Lastly</em><em>… </em><em>I saw on your Twitter that you</em><em>’</em><em>re a Taurus. A fellow bull has to ask -</em> <em>do you put much stock in astrology? </em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I only put as much stock in astrology as I am allowed to without using it to justify bad behavior. I think it’s a cool avenue to use to explore yourself, your friends, and the world around you as long as it’s being used for good!</p>",

		"slug" : "SearchingforBigDatainSharonWeinbergersTheImagineersofWar",
		"body" : "<p><br></p><p>These days, I often feel like I’m using Big Data to figure out the history of Big Data so I can better understand how Big Data is making me obsessed with Big Data. There are a few things I know for sure about this often perplexing pattern:<br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. The history of Big Data and the rise of  the Internet appeals to me in part because I know it is inextricably tied to the history of American National Security and the rise of the military-industrial complex, 1950-1990, which also feels super consequential. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. The plethora of data-driven archival databases and the precise search methods within them make it possible—in ways unimaginable even fifteen years ago—to pin down the corporations, figures, and products that made possible both the incomprehensible vastness of our government’s worldwide surveillance state and the incomprehensible vastness of the Internet. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. The metamodern elements of searching for origin stories of the Internet using the data systems provided by the Internet has been making my head spin and leading me to do kind of unreasonable things, like using the myriad ProQuest historical newspaper databases conglomerated within Harvard’s HOLLIS library system to collect and post on Flickr the<strong> <a href=\"https://flic.kr/s/aHskR9Yi8J\"><u>graphics from 175 defense contractor recruitment advertisements</u></a> </strong>(ProQuest search: “COMPUTER” and “MISSILE” w/ Document Type: Advertisement, Date Range 1950-1990, as contractors pretty much stopped making these kinds of alluring doodles once the Internet emerged and could call them on the dissonance of using pop art to locate missile technicians), or spending eight hours on Wikipedia jumping from Raytheon to MITRE Corporation to Bendix to Varian Associates to...well, you know. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Trump’s warhawkery probably makes these collection binges feel more justified—if we are going down, we might as well understand how we got here, right? And if we <em>aren’t </em>going down, then it may be in part because Trump & Co. are consulting with some forces who have a deeper knowledge of recent national security/big data history. Our world’s survival chances just might go up if everyone knows when Martin Marietta became merged with Lockheed or how Agent Orange ended up all over Vietnam’s jungles.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. I am far from alone in these proclivities, as Thursday, March 23rd suggested…</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I got out of my History of Big Data seminar—taught by the oracular History of Science professor Rebecca Lemov—at 4 P.M. and half-jogged to Café Pamplona, taking my iPhone 6s out of my pocket and feeling an acute anxiety-pang in my neck when I realized I had no reason to consult my Anything-Phone. I then put my phone away and got it out again to make sure the meeting really <em>was </em>at 4:05 P.M. Of course the meeting was at 4:05 P.M. But a quick look at Gmail as I crossed Bow Street couldn’t possibly hurt. I was probably in a particularly vicious cycle of phone-checking because our seminar that day had focused on visions of the “Data Soul,” attempts by conceptual artists and social scientists to conceptualize the financial and social worth of their collective data footprint. Professor Lemov had introduced the class, whose members are split between skittish philosopher-historians and far more stoic computer programmers, to the plight of Steve Mann, the “father of wearable computing.” Mann was assaulted in a Paris McDonald’s in 2012 by three men trying to grab his digital eyeglasses. Mann's device, which has been pretty consistently affixed to his head for 34 years and is not removable without special tools, captured the beatdown on its camera. It was a scary and violent scene. So I was already feeling a little bit protective of Farquad (my iPhone’s name) and also concerned  existentially that Farquad is already permanently affixed to my left hip.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> I was to talk with Sharon Weinberger, an author whose work on the intersection between science, society, and national security in First Look Media’s (see: <em>Citizenfour</em>) magazine <em>The Intercept </em>and in her new book <em>The Imagineers of War</em> speaks directly to my numbered points above. Her book is an almost 60-year history of DARPA (The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), the Department of Defense sub-organization whose ARPANET became the foundations of the Internet and whose other diverse defense projects range from the retrospectively pretty practical (nuclear test detection, GPS), to the depressingly problematic (counterinsurgency methods lifted from British Malaya, Agent Orange and strategic hamlets in Vietnam), to the utterly mind-melting (mecha-elephants, telekinesis, super advanced artificial intelligence drones). </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am more than a little bit intimidated by Weinberger’s general knowledge of national security and of her ability to weave such an informative and surreal narrative out of DARPA. So when I sat down at the table and ordered my large Americano in a put-on bass-baritone voice, I was probably very clearly nervous. Café Pamplona also played a role in my quasi-dissociation, as its red quaintness and partial submergence makes it feel like the kind of inconspicuous place where really crazy, under-the-table, Harvard-MIT-affiliated National Security dealings have occurred. Which they probably have. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When I asked Weinberger if she also felt the hive mind coming together in some sort of Big Data self-reckoning, she responded emphatically: “We’re definitely at an interesting inflection point right now, and one that I didn’t necessarily expect. There are a number of scholars and journalists right now who are asking the question, ‘What happens when you have a big chunk of your science budget funded by national security?’” Weinberger also quickly tied in this renewed fascination, which she believed faded from the public discourse after the Berlin Wall came down, to Trumpian intrigue. “If you saw the news on the Trump budget, they are proposing cutting things like climate research, National Institutes of Health, a lot of civil science, but not military science.” And although the specific allocations of defense spending are still obscure, Weinberger revealed that there has always been a correlation between military spending and spikes in the budget for DARPA and other military science-based organizations. “I absolutely bet that DARPA’s budget will go up.\"</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Weinberger is remarkably forthcoming, amiable, and rhetorically agile. While I was by no means trying to be annoying with my questions, they were often sort of half-baked and unnecessarily wordy, the kind of queries I could imagine a respondent brushing off as try-hard profundity and then offering the back-cover synopsis of their book. Weinberger not only comprehended my garbled prose, she also responded with answers full of strategy, reference, and demystification. On the question of the meta-search for the Internet on the Internet, for example: “The Internet is great for finding rabbit holes. You now have libraries that are pushing their archives online. The American Institute of Physics had a large number of DARPA-related interviews that I used to have to go out to College Park to retrieve. We were only allowed to copy one-third of each interview. It was very weird. And then at some point I think they asked, ‘Why are we trying to make access to this historical material harder?’ So they put them online.” Where before I had only seen the media, she gave me the message: Research institutions were <em>recognizing </em>the importance of their Internet histories and were meta-uploading them as a result. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Weinberger’s book, which at a spry 375 pages still feels somehow authoritative and expansive, is a deft mix of household names for people interested in this stuff (Sputnik, famed computer pioneer J.C.R. Licklider) and totally obscure material. Weinberger places the figure of William Godel, an almost un-Googleable DARPA ‘imagineer,’ at the center of Operation Paperclip, the famed Score I launch, and much of early 1960s Vietnam policy. How did Weinberger <em>find </em>this guy and the several other extremely significant figures she recovers from true erasure? “I’m a collector and hoarder of information. I love archives. I love interviews.” By this point I was feeling a great degree of self-centered kinship and was having trouble resisting the urge to mention my crazed military graphix side-project. “Especially with the people from the early days of DARPA, the name that kept coming up was this guy William Godel. And I did the same thing. I Googled him. And, you know, there are a few references. But everyone kept saying, ‘He was this critical guy.’” Weinberger’s persistent search for Godel’s lost legacy led her to Atlanta, where hundreds of pages from his 1965 depositions are stored. “He was accused of fraud and went to jail and got written out of history,” Weinberg explained with a tone of real empathy for the guy. “He would probably have been the head of the NSA...he was the star.” </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The scenes in <em>The Imagineers of War </em>detailing Godel’s conviction are truly depressing; Godel, who had been accustomed to a loose spending leash in Vietnam, got dragged into the far more explosive scandal of his Pentagon colleague John Wylie, who was actually embezzling funds for glitzy cars and boats. Despite the obvious differences between Godel and Wylie’s crimes, both men ultimately got five years and ruined reputations. It’s not exactly easy to feel bad for the man who introduced Agent Orange, but Weinberger’s access to the Atlanta depositions allowed her to paint Godel with such complexity that he becomes hard to condemn. Godel was by no means a gung-ho killer. His counterinsurgency tactics were designed to limit the Vietnam War, and he watched in horror from prison as, in his words, “we ended up trying to win the war with technology.” “He was a thinker,” Weinberger concluded. “He thought about how to fight the wars of tomorrow...He was a flawed figure, but a fascinating one.” </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I Googled my way through the entirety of Weinberger’s book and in doing so the 375 pages stretched into a Megillah of YouTube videos, declassified documents, articles from all manners of open-source journals, and dead ends on several other Godel-style figures. I asked Weinberger if she thought about this kind of ulterior research in her writing—was she able to limit the page count because she knew that particularly interested readers had an encyclopedic domain to which they could turn? “It’s very rare that you read a book and find something that just doesn’t exist on Google,” she agreed. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although Weinberger acknowledged that it is jarring to live in an age of narrative history in which the transference of information is less crucial, she also sees a new opportunity to work on craft: “The answer is not brevity, it’s how you write that story. For narrative history, the arc of the story you want to tell is what matters. Even if that information is out there, it’s out there in different ways.” Through Weinberger’s  inclusion of obscure historical actors and willingness to jump over less important filler (“Not every DARPA director is interesting...it’s the fertile facts you need to choose,” her editor suggested), she steered clear of creating an information dump. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By this juncture in our talk, we had both finished our legendarily caffeinated Pamplona drinks and were talking—I’m listening to this on Voice Memos and cracking up—at a far faster and more exhilarated pace than when we began. I hope some of this freneticism was also a result of the intensity of our discourse. I relayed how I keep thinking I'm stumbling onto something super-secret in my own ProQuesting and data-dives (“If I could only connect the dots between this 1976 Halliburton Report and this <em>Baltimore Sun </em>mention of Dick Cheney…”). I told Weinberger how astonishing it was that she is <em>actually </em>having to make immensely difficult judgment calls on a daily basis about the impact of releasing classified information, both in her book and in her national security reportage. In the final chapter of <em>The Imagineers of War</em>, Weinberger explores DARPA’s work in Afghanistan’s data mining up until 2013. “I was interviewing a development worker who had helped with this DARPA program to collect data,” she told me with a new gravitas in her tone. “She was describing how they were giving smartphones to Afghans claiming that they were collecting humanitarian information and in reality it was for military intelligence. And I was really torn by that, because it was <em>wrong. </em>They were putting these Afghans at risk without them knowing they were at risk. And writing that potential you put the development worker at some level of risk, potentially you put Afghans at risk.”</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The dilemmas only got more wrenching. Although Weinberger was not able to talk about her day-to-day journalism for reasons that will become obvious over the course of this hypothetical, she offered me a situation indicative of the choices she often has to make. “Suppose one had documents about drone strikes in Country X and the U.S. government says, ‘Please redact. If you give this information, it will be easier for militants to avoid the drone strikes, and thus you’d be helping terrorists.’ Well, what if it’s your belief that drone strikes are illegitimate? Or that the drone strikes are also killing civilians? You get into all these theoretical conversations. I don’t know what you say. You make the best decision you can.” </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Despite how much I’m fascinated by Weinberger’s work, empathizing with that kind of burden of responsibility terrified me, particularly after Weinberger asked a series of questions so difficult to answer that I produced a series of groan noises for thirty seconds: “Are we advocates for the U.S. government? If we listen to those requests from the U.S. government, what if it were from Iran? Russia? France? Are there legitimate and illegitimate governments?”</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Weinberger and I talked for thirty more minutes about the unexpected utility of her own defense consultancy work after graduate school. “If you oppose having a Department of Defense and everything a Department of Defense does, then you should not work for a defense contractor. I believe personally that countries have a legitimate right and role to conduct national security affairs,” she told me, adding that the work she accomplished working with Systems Planning Corporation (look them up) gave her a unique perspective into the “weird logic” of the myriad outsourced defense analysis firms that are sprinkled all over Northern Virginia. We also discussed the under-researched military contractor Sierra Nevada (look them up, too), and the <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/webdev17\"><u>YouTube profile</u></a> </strong>of an incredibly mysterious man (Men? Many people?) named Jeff Quitney, who has somehow uploaded several thousand retro promotional films from the defense establishment. If you know <em>anything </em>about Jeff Quitney and how I may join him in whatever it is he’s doing, please, please get in touch. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I left my conversation with Weinberger with a new steely determination not to let the surreal nature of the relationship between Big Data and the military overwhelm me. Clearly, as Weinberger’s whole career illustrates, there are ways to engage critically with the behemoth and retain some degree of sanity and autonomy. Ultimately, Weinberger appears fueled by a genuine love for the game. As we finally rose from our Pamplona think tank, she explained how the true melding of science and national security journalism had clicked for her : “For me, it was a special, under-covered area of national security science that just fascinated me....Science journalists weren’t used to calling the Pentagon asking for an interview with no answer. I’m used to making 10 calls and then harassing them and threatening to sue them under the Freedom of Information Act.” </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I’m sure I’m still going to have paranoid triple-phone check moments or go one too many steps down the rabbit hole of a defense contractor’s history and end up pacing through the library for hours wondering if we would have gotten the Internet without DARPA or its shadowy defense contractor brothers and sisters. But Weinberger’s determination to accurately historicize our government’s endlessly confusing inner workings gives me hope: maybe one day I can contextualize all this stuff and tell neurotic Harvard kids at Café Pamplona how the puzzle fits together.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br><br><br></p>",

		"body" : "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Elif Batuman –– acclaimed <i>New Yorker </i>contributor, recent author of <i>The Idiot (</i>a novel set at Harvard in the ’90’s) and former <i>Advocate</i> member ––  is every bit as genial, witty and inspiring as her Twitter page makes her out to be. It was truly a pleasure to have the chance to chat with her about her debut novel, The Idiot, Turkish heritage, and the 19<sup>th</sup> century Russian novel. She proves that it is, in fact, possible to be dazzlingly intelligent, publish two best-selling books and still be one of the warmest, most approachable people ever.<br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">B- We're very excited about The Idiot. How did you decide on your subject matter, and how was it to transition from writing mostly non-fiction to fiction?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">E- The Idiot is based on a draft that I wrote many years ago in 2000-2001; at that point I was in my early 20s. My freshman year of college, which is the subject matter of The Idiot, was something that I was still thinking about a lot at that time, as I was trying to finish my first year at graduate school. It was a more intuitive choice, I think, for a 22-23 year-old than it was for a 38 year-old, which is the age I was when I revised the manuscript. I worked on it for a while. I went to graduate school right after Harvard and then took a year off after the first year to try to write a novel - I wrote this very long document that had most of The Idiot in it, but it also had a lot of other stuff in it and it just didn't somehow add up to a novel, so I ended up going back to school. I stayed there for 7 years and I got the PhD and life sort of went in another direction. Then, around 2012, I started work on another novel, which was going to be about another Turkish American writer for a New Yorker-like magazine living in Istanbul, and it was in the middle of that, and with various formal and other difficulties, that I ended up revisiting the draft of this older novel and writing it then. Sorry for the long, convoluted answer - that's how it happened!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">B - It's brilliant to know how the process unfurled. As a Turk, I wanted to ask you - how connected do you feel to Turkey? Particularly after reading The Idiot, I see that your protagonist Selin is constantly thinking about her heritage and her parents - what does it mean to you to be Turkish American?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">E - I don't know, for a long time it didn't mean as much to me as well, but I can't really say that either. Growing up, I had a Turkish name, obviously, so that meant that there was a certain amount of explanation that had to take place almost on a daily level. I think, as with a lot of children whose parents are from a different country than the one that they're living in, it does put the child in an interesting situation from an early age. To an extent I felt that I was explaining the American school system and American childhood to my parents, and at the same time, when I would go to my friends' houses their parents would immediately ask me all these question about Turkey, viewing me as the spokesperson for all of Turkey. Whereas when we would go to Turkey every summer to see my grandparents, I was the spokesperson for America and everyone treated me basically like a Martian, which is what I was. So ,from an early age it was something that I wasn't really able to, or allowed to ignore because other people kept bringing it to my attention. At the same time, I had this idea that I got from my mother - that nationality was in the end quite a superficial facet of someone's identity, and that foolish people make a great deal out of it. Actually, we're all citizens of the world, and people when would ask her \"what kind of name is Olcay?\" she would get kind of impatient and say \"I don't see what that has to do with anything.\" I had that idea, too, that what country you're from doesn't really have to do with anything. One of the things I write about in The Idiot is meeting international students for the first time who are from countries that have histories with Turkey, especially countries from the Balkans. Those people related to me completely as a Turkish person and brought to bear all their feelings about Ottoman occupation, so it was something that I had to think about in a different way in college. Then, all those thoughts changed again in 2010, because that's when I went to live in Turkey for the first time - it was the first time that I spent more than a couple of months there. I was there between 2010-2013 during the protests, and I left towards the end of 2013. I think that was a time, too, when the idea of Turkish identity was changing for people within and outside of Turkey.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">B- Going back to what you said about having to explain certain things to your parents - how easy, or difficult, was it to tell them that you wanted to pursue writing?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">E - I remember talking to a friend who couldn't tell his parents he was a writer, and had to pretend he was in law school because his parents would be very angry. That was not a difficult thing I had in my life. My parents had their own research labs, they had a lot going on, and they were both big readers. My mother was the bigger fiction-reader, now my father also reads a lot of fiction, though it wasn't always the case! There was some respect that surrounded the idea of writing. We didn't know any writers, but it wasn't the kind of household where all they cared about was making money. They were both researchers, and making money was never their main priority. If anything, I think I've become more aware of money as a concern only later in life through my own experiences, as opposed to anything that my parents taught me, which I do realise is an unusual experience, not for anyone, but particularly for people with parents from other countries. So, I was lucky in a way.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">B – In another interview, you talked about the importance of narrative perspective. To what extent would you say that Selin's mind is a temporally and spatially equivalent to yours during your freshman year?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">E - How much of me was in the narrator? That's an interesting question. The book I wrote before The Idiot was called The Possessed, and it was a book that I wanted to write as a novel, but for commercial and other reasons was persuaded to write it as non-fiction. I'd also been writing non-fiction for the New Yorker for a while, and I do the kind of voice where the first person is a constant, possibly annoying presence, interpolating their thoughts and experiences. Stylistically, I don't think that there's a huge difference between first-person narrative non-fiction and a first-person novel. I had the same kind of interest in the limitations of perspective, and in dialogue and describing scenes -  I still thought of it very much in those terms. And yet, I did find that thinking about the character of Selin was different from thinking about the first-person narrator in The Possessed or in other non-fictions that I wrote, in a way that I found very freeing and fun, because I realised that writing nonfiction, I felt a lot of pressure and responsibility to present myself in a somewhat representative way that other people would agree with or recognise as forming some coherent part of the rest of reality. I didn't want to emphasise something and downplay other things - with fiction that wasn't a concern. This is probably the case with most novelists, I think that it must be very difficult to write someone feeling things that you've never felt before. Pretty much everything Selin feels and many of the things that she thinks are things that I've felt and thought before, but they're not a representative picture of what I think I'm like; they're a curated picture of a kind of person who I thought has certain overlaps with my own personality, but it was very freeing to think that she didn't have to be a mirror or portrait.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">B - You wrote in several pieces about the impact Harvard had on you, especially your freshman year. To quote you, you also once said that \"I do think that it's in the nature of education to be whimsical and haphazard.\" How do you think college shaped you and how does it come back to you in your life beyond?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">E - One never really knows... those four years are so important. You think so much about where to go and what to do and every choice that you make, and it does seem true that there are some important decisions that have ramifications in your adult life. You can't really know how things would have been different without getting to live another life, which one doesn't get to do. One thing that was very important to me, career-wise, was my relationship with n+1, which was started by advocate members who I knew a little bit when I was an undergraduate. The first piece that I ever published was in 2006 with n+1, and that led directly to my getting to write for The New Yorker which was an amazing opportunity, so I do feel very lucky about that. Beyond that, I don't know - would I have gotten so into Russian Literature if I had been somewhere that didn't have such a good Russian programme, or where I didn't meet the same people? I can think of a lot of ways that might have affected and might continue to affect my life.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">B- \"Our dean says in every other speech that these four years are meant to be formative and transformative, and we're always pushed towards finding ourselves, finding and challenging our limits, which sounds easy?! In the novel, I think Selin grapples with a similar dilemma - the novel seems to lay out, almost in a Salingerian tradition, a sort of youth that is dazzlingly dynamic in thought, that's not confined by these guiding questions or manners in which we're taught to think and behave. She wanders and dwells on the minutiae that makes life colourful - is that something you bore in mind throughout the writing process? Was she always such a free-spirited character, from the very start?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">E - The way I thought about Selin - again, it's not a 100% accurate picture of me - is definitely as an element of who I was. She has a kind of impatience and intolerance, and even just bewilderment with the most conventional formulae of language. She thinks that in some ways they're optional, and that there are some other forms of language that are not totally conventional. So, for all those speeches in which you're told these years are going to be transformative - well she just listens to those and thinks \"well what does that actually mean?\" She goes to all her classes, and whatever the professor has to say on that day, she says \"so this is human knowledge,\" which is of course an absurd standard to put anything anyone says to. She doesn't really realise that - and there's a part where she goes to a job interview at Let's Go and they ask her \"what do we miss out on if we don't hire you?\" which is a standard interview question, but she's never heard it before, and she thinks \"that's completely perverse, why would they ask me something that?\" She's doesn't realise yet that there are all of these situations where people have to say certain things, and those things by definition cannot be of 100% perfect and truthful expression of something that actually exists in someone's soul. Therefore, there's all of this language floating around in the world that's just kind of an approximation or a symbol or token that doesn't actually stand for anything real and meaningful in anyone's brain. She doesn't know that yet, and can't accept and doesn't like it, so she's always in tension with the rest of the world because of that.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">B- Needless to say you're a fan of Russian Literature; Tolstoy is one of my favourite writers. In Anna Karenina I always like to pick up on is the strong undercurrent of affection and imitation in the Karenin family with regards to “francophilia.” Do you think Selin's experience emulates that in terms of being a bridge between the American adolescent experience and her parents or friends?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">E - When I went to graduate school to study Russian Literature, first my professors who were Russian would say \"oh how interesting, one of our new graduate students is of Turkish descent,\" and then they would say \"that makes so much sense, you must have been drawn to Russian Literature because Turkey, like Russia, is one of the few countries that's between Europe and Asia.\" In fact, Peter the Great and Ataturk were quite similar - their plans in terms of westernising reforms were quite similar; the position of the elite culture with regards to secularism, and the feudal village culture that's still in place long after the modernisation of cities are the same in Turkey and Russia... But I thought, \"how sad it is that they have a nationalistic explanation for something in me that is so universal and transcends all of that.\" It's only now as an adult that I've realised, actually, that was a big part of what drew me to Russian Literature. I think of the novel as being a form about a person who has certain books that they really like, and wants their life to resemble those books, but it doesn't. The prototype is Don Quixote - he goes out and instead of a windmill he sees a giant, and collides with it; that collision is the productive space of the novel. I think that there's something about the situation of Russia in the 19th century - and maybe Turkey doesn't have the same novel traditions, but I think there's something in the Russian novel that also resonates with Turkish culture - which is somehow deeply novelistic, because the people were steeped in western literary culture in the 19th century and all spoke fluent French. They knew all of these novels; writers like Tolstoy, Dostoevsky and Pushkin all read French fluently and read French novels. In a way those novels described something they recognised very closely, but in another way, they were very foreign to them because they were describing a different reality, which is always the case in any novel, but it's exacerbated in the case of a country like Russia that's between the East and the West. I think it was kind of the same for me, in that in the 90s, going to college, I knew of fewer narratives about immigrant experience. You would hear about the Latino experience, but that was it. The experience that I was having with the kinds of nationalities that were involved, and the class dynamics were not reflected in literature or in movies, so I did have a very strong feeling of having an experience I hadn't seen represented for the most part. That was definitely a productive feeling for the novel, and I'm sure some of that went into The Idiot.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">B- In another interview you mentioned that Haruki Murakami was one of your favourite living authors. Could you talk about that a bit, why do you enjoy Murakami so much?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">E - I've wondered about that... I first read Murakami in high school; I remember I was taking violin lessons at the Manhattan School of Music, and I walked into the Barnard Book Store which was right near there, and upon seeing it’s cover I bought Dance Dance Dance - I thought it was amazing. There's this bemusement he has with everything that's humorous but also perplexed at the same time. Despite his hyper-normalcy, a lot of his imagery is unusual as well. There's something about his tone, mood, and voice, that I find extremely relaxing and compulsive - it's just a place I want to be. I don't think it has that much to do with his plots - I care about the mystic cats and the missing women, but it's really about being in that world with his first-person narrator.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">B - What would like, if anything, your readers to gather from The Idiot?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">E - I just feel very strongly is that one of the things that literature – the novel – can do is by conveying the irremediable specificity of any one person's lived experience, which includes all the facets of their identity, it gives you those details and allows for you to have a universal experience. I assume most of the readers will not share Selin's national background or her identity, but I hope that they won't feel pushed away by that, and that they'll recognise parts of their own experience in hers. Responses from readers that have made me the happiest have been about that - I have heard from readers with very different experiences who've said they recognised what it is to be young and lost. I think that a lot of those experiences are quite universal. I guess the paradox is that there are these universal experiences, but if you describe to describe them in a universal way and say \"remember the time one was young and didn't know what to do, and stumbled into missteps?\" it's hard to have that resonate with people when it's put that vaguely, but if you tell a specific story, even if the details are different, that somehow gives you access to more universal feelings. I think this is something the novel does that is so special, and I'll be really happy if the The Idiot has done that for my readers.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">B - Thank you so much for this wonderful interview. One last question before I leave - which board where you on in The Advocate?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">E - I was on the fiction board, but I wrote for the non-fiction side - already it was messed up!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">B - Teşekkür ederim!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">E - Ben teşekkür ederim, başarılar dilerim!</p>",

		"title" : "An Interview with Xiu Xiu",
		"slug" : "AnInterviewwithXiuXiu",
		"body" : "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jamie Stewart, a square-jawed man with a razor-sharp side-part, has a low voice, a few tattoos, and the airs of someone with a strict hygiene regimen. Stewart is the anchor behind Xiu Xiu, a dark experimental act out of San Jose, whose combination of relentless nihilism and dry humor often splits the critics. Stewart is Xiu Xiu’s only constant player –– the band has added and shed eleven members since forming in 2002 ––  and the band’s sound, like its membership, is always changing. Their repertoire ranges from the grim and percussive <em>Angel Guts: Red Classroom</em>, to <em>Plays the Music of Twin Peaks</em> (a bleak but lovingly rendered take on the cult TV show’s soundtrack), to <em>Nina</em> (an out-there tribute album to Nina Simone, that sounds more like an out-of-breath Anohni [à la <em>Hopelessness</em>] than anything from the Simone catalogue) to the upbeat, nearly noise-pop <em>Forget</em>, the band’s tenth release, which came out this past February. I met with Stewart in the front seat of an immaculate white SUV and chatted about band names, the creative process, and stuffed animals.<em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><br></em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: You have said publicly that your band name comes from the young female protagonist of a Chinese film. What’s the story behind how you chose that name?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A: The band name is from a movie directed by Joan Chen called “Xiu Xiu the Sent-down Girl.” It was released in the late ‘90’s. The person that I started Xiu Xiu with –– he and I were housemates at the time –– and we had both seen the movie independently of each other. In the movie, which takes place during the Cultural Revolution in China, the character Xiu Xiu, at every turn, is attempting to improve her life situation. But, everything she tries to do makes things worse. She eventually dies in the end. And Cory McCulloch –– the guy I started the band with –– although circumstantially obviously things were totally different, we were feeling close to the character Xiu Xiu in that everything we were doing to improve our lives was also just leading to things getting worse. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: For a band whose style changes so drastically album to album, do you find that with each shift the band makes that the band name moves with it? Have you ever thought about changing your name for different projects or is there a reason you’ve stuck to one?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A: I don’t know, I’ve talked to different publicists we’ve had about the possibility changing the band name, you know, if we do something dramatically different. They said to consider bands that we have admired that have done things dramatically different and they always kept their names. It made sense to me that, if you’re a band for a couple of years, if you’re a music fan as well as a musician, it makes sense that you would explore different avenues. Although there is an impulse to change the name, because it sort of re-sets a newer mind, perhaps, what the possible parameters could be. But, as they noted, when one thinks about one’s predecessors’ maintaining their name and exploring different things, there is a precedent for allowing one to jump off different bridges. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: It also might confuse the fans a little. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A: It does not often help [laughs]. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: I was just reading an interview with Dedekind Cut and he said some fans have been confused by all his names. Because he was “¬ b” [“Not Bannon”] and before that he was Lee Bannon, and then was with Pro Era –– it can be hard for people to track. But it also makes sense, because he, like you, has made massive genre changes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A: I think in techno and hip-hop there’s a little more precedent for it. But as far as being in a rock band, there isn’t as much. A friend of mine was in this band called Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, and he had, you know, as small but devoted following, and then he changed his name and he’s really struggling with having made that decision.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: Wait, what did he change it to? </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A: That’s what I mean. You’re one of the fans he lost. He changed it to Advance Base –– it’s a video game reference –– and, I think he’s been regretting it since. I’m not sure why he doesn’t just change it back. I’m sure he has his reasons. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: So, you’re the only constant member of Xiu Xiu since 2002. You started playing with Angela Seo in 2009 and Shayna Dunkelman in 2012, and several others along the way. Are there specific elements to your sound that were brought on by various people who have played with you over the years?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A: Oh yeah, absolutely. I mean, everyone who has been involved has, with rare exception, has been a genuinely brilliant and singular player. Each person has added something, I don’t have a graph [laughs], but the reason I have someone playing something is because they have a personality. Because they add something to the music that is them. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: So, <em>Forget</em> just came out. And it struck me and I think a lot of the people that I’ve read online, as kind of a shift, certainly from <em>Plays the Music of Twin Peaks</em>, but also from the Xiu Xiu catalogue, in that, it’s almost a noise-pop album. But I’ve read that you don’t necessarily agree with that reading.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A: Well, I think the aspect that I don’t quite agree with is that somebody –– and this seems to happen with every other record that we’ve ever done –– seems to to attach  the word “accessible.” <em>This is the most accessible record Xiu Xiu has ever done!</em> I mean it happened in 2004, it happened in 2008, it happened in 2012, and it’s happening again with this record. I think the implication is that I think people perceive Xiu Xiu as being a band that just does completely unlistenable noise music, which I don’t think is the case. But I’m absolutely the person whose opinion matters the least in this. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But, this record is essentially song-based, so I think people are attaching the idea of pop to it. When we were working on it, we weren’t thinking of it as a pop-record. We were thinking of it as a “songs” record, in, I think, the traditional craft of songwriting, not so much the top-forty manner of songwriting. We certainly weren’t trying to make a record that was accessible or that was pop. I think essentially we were trying to <em>not try</em> to do anything. And just allow it to evolve into what it was going to evolve into. In this case, that turned out to be songs. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I think probably the most influential pop element for us was a late-fifties, early sixties producer named Joe Meek, who is sort of a pioneer of incredible, almost over-produced, super lush, melodramatic, excessively romantic kind of proto-rock-n-roll, torch songs. He invented a ton of studio techniques that at the time were completely revolutionary –– you know, like close-miking, echo, excessive compression on sounds. He was one of the first person to really use a studio as an instrument. But he was also a greater, almost over-the-top arranger –– so I think the pop element came from him. I think when people had said that this was a pop record, I thought that they were referring to ideas of current top forty –– if I was ever bristling, it was at that. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: As you said, this was a songs record, but I’ve read that you initially tried to make it under very narrow constraints and found that difficult. Can you elaborate on what you initially pictured and explain why that broke down?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The previous record, <em>Angel Guts: Red Classroom</em>, we had a really specific set of rules for, and for that record it was super fruitful. I really liked working at that time within those very, very, narrow constraints. And I thought that, that worked, so we’ll just come up with a narrow set of constraints for a different record, this upcoming record, which ended up being <em>Forget</em>. But we couldn’t really come up with any that we felt good about. We tried a few here and there, and different combinations, but nothing was yielding anything and it went on for a really long time, with nothing happening that sounded good. Off the top of my head I can’t really think up any of the ill-fated combinations.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: What does it mean to make rules?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A: Well, with the case of <em>Angel Guts</em>, the rules were that we could only use analog drum machines and analog synthesizers and a minimum amount of percussion and vocals, and those would be the only instruments we could use. We’re basically just going to draw on Kraftwerk, Nico, Suicide, Einstürzende Neubauten. We were trying to push those worlds together, and that’s what we were doing with the album. With <em>Forget</em>, or rather the songs that would <em>not</em> become <em>Forget</em>, we wanted kind of a narrow definition of what it could be. But we weren’t able to come up with a combination that worked. So, we just went the total opposite direction. We said there would be no rules and no thinking. Essentially, we just tried to listen to the goddess of music [laughs] and sing what she said was true. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: And is that where the title comes from –– is it obliquely tied into that process?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A: Well, it’s a difficult record to talk about in linear terms, I think because it was not really made in a linear way. So that very well may be the case, but in attempting to have as little intellectuality attached to it, I cannot be totally certain that there is a reference to that process in the title. For me, there is a particular meaning to the title –– like a personal meaning for the title –– but I don’t know if it was necessarily woven into the way that the record was made, but it is certainly possible. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: Can you elaborate on that?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A: Oh yeah, with the caveat that this is just my personal meaning. I’m hesitant to insert my own interpretations on it. Because it’s very important to the band –– the whole point of the band essentially is that people have their own interpretations of things. We’re not making this record to impose our ideas on the world. We have our ideas about it. It has a meaning for us. But once we’re done with it, it’s not for us anymore. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But for me, the title is kind of two things. One, in a very uninteresting and personal way, is that I –– this is so boring –– I, like fucking everyone, just have a really difficult time with depression. A big part of how it manifests for me is that I’ll get stuck on negative thoughts. Probably 80% of the time, when I’m conscious, I’m just thinking of one negative thought all of the time. It’s super aggravating. It has occurred to me in the last couple of years that I can take some conscious steps to force myself to think about something else, although it takes a fair amount of will to do it –– and energy. So the idea of “forgetting” as a coping mechanism essentially, part of it is about that.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The other idea is that, in some ways for me, I’ve found forgetting to be something very useful –– but forgetting can also be something incredibly sad and tragic. By definition, it is essentially loss. Sometimes that loss can be very, very freeing. But also by definition, the loss of something you were trying to hold onto –– sombody’s face whom you have loved or some of the people you have seen, some kind of connection that you had with somebody that at one point felt very, very palpable but then dissolves –– obviously, that stuff can be very, very sad. So, I was thinking about forgetting a lot, and the idea of forgetting as something that can be both extraordinarily helpful, and probably the only reason human beings can exist without [laughs] blowing their heads off and things, but at the same time, it’s a double edged sword.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: In the opening of Forget, you sample a really fast paced verse from Enyce Smith, the Banjee Ball commentator. When did you first come across Smith's stuff? And how did that collaboration play out? </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A: It was just by chance. Angelo Seo and I are really close friends and hang out a lot –– from Xiu XIu, Angela Seo from Xiu Xiu. There’s this legendary club in Los Angeles called Los Globos, and she said this band that she liked was going on. We went out and Enyce Smith was doing the commentary on it. It was mind bogglingly intense –– and creative and interesting and funny and kind of frightening. For <em>hours</em>  he was maintaining a level of excitement and intensity that just never let up. I had never seen anybody do something that <em>relentless</em> before, vocally. I left and I was like, “Aw man, you know I’d love to do something like that.” But I thought, “I can’t do anything like that, <em>he </em>has to do it, there’s no possible way that I could do that.” So, I looked online and found his email. I wrote him, and he doesn’t live that far away from me by chance. A couple days afterwards he came over. It took like ten minutes. I just played him a song and he improvised over it. His timing was perfect. I just edited what he did into the song, and then he left. And that was it [laughs]. I was sort of shocked at how quickly it occurred. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: Your work typically deals with pretty dark subject matter –– suicide, loneliness, insanity, abortion, rape, war crimes, the gamut ––  but there’s always a touch of humor and lightheartedness in there. Like <em>Fabulous Muscles</em> for example, takes up really dark stuff, child abuse and suicide and so on, but on the cover, you’re cuddling a kitten. What role do you see humor or cuteness playing in your music?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A: Internally, it feels very natural. It feels very much, essentially, how what my internal life is. By physiological design and by circumstance and I think just by interest, I’m very much drawn to the dark side of life. But equally I’m super interested, I have a huge stuffed animal collection, I love cats. My baby nephews are my favorites people in the world. So it’s just the way god made me, essentially. I think the idea of –– in no way is Xiu Xiu a joke band, I think joke music is really aggravating and pointless –– but I think that there, I agree with you that there is a certain level of humor in the songs that we try to do. And I think that idea (no surprise here) really comes from Morrissey and The Smiths. Those lyrics are obviously you know, the pinnacle of gloom-pop as it were, but they’re also hilarious. Like within one song you’ll have lyrics about killing yourself and then a little later a lyric where someone has barfed on their sweater or something. Ever since I was a teenager, he’s been one of my favorite singers. So, I think we very pointedly created that approach from him. And then that’s just how I am made.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: You have a large stuffed animal collection?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A: Yeah…well I got the idea from the composer Charlemagne Palestine. He has an infinitely larger stuffed animal collection than me. But I read an article about him having one many, many years ago, and I thought –– that’s not a bad idea [laughs].</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\" rel=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: In a TMT interview, you wrote that <em>Plays the Music of Twin Peaks,</em> which came out last year wasn’t a “re-imagining” of the TV show’s soundtrack so much as a “thank you” to it. Is that different from how you approached <em>Nina</em>? </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A: Oh no, I mean <em>Nina</em> was a thank-you also.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q. Okay, so when you approach music that is made, and iconic –– how do you think about making changes to the thing that the artist did?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A: It’s not <em>really</em> an intellectual process. The way that we have tried to say thank you –– every single song that we’ve covered has tried to say thank-you. We’ve done a lot of cover songs. It’s essentially just trying to play in the way that that artist has informed our playing. Trying to play what we have learned from them, or in the way that we have learned from them. Or, I’m not really sure how else to say it. So just trying to be ourselves, but ourselves is deeply and profoundly shaped by who those other singers or composers or musicians were. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: So at the radio station that I was going to take you to [WHRB], to join the punk station you usually ––</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A:  –– [laughs] kill people?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: –– yeah, burn stuff, do some recommended listening, and then you play five songs a week on someone else’s show.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A: Like as a guest?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: Yep, and when I was doing that I randomly pulled out <em>A Promise</em> and played Ian Curtis Wishlist. That was the first time I’d ever heard you guys. I recently looked that up, and you said an Ian Curtis Wishlist “is a list of things that you have convinced yourself that you want to have happen, but you know that are never going to happen.” So, I’m wondering if there are some things you have on your Ian Curtis wishlist.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A: [laughs] There is NO way I would ever admit to them in public. Of course I do! But they’re way too mortifying. I think there was probably a period of time where I would have admitted to them in public, but I think I’ve become slightly more private in the past few years. Oh god, I wish the answer was no, but yes, definitely, definitely yes. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Q: And, last question –– what albums have you been listening to lately? </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A: My listening habits are kind of limited. I just listen to three or four things a lot, and then kind of move on to the next little batch. I’ve been listening to a lot of  –– well they’re actually kind of related, historically. But I’ve been listening to a lot of Haitian vodou drumming and then Yoruba drumming also. Then, on the complete other side of the map, I realized that I hadn’t listened to The Cure in a couple years. So I’ve been reacquainting myself with The Cure, which is kind of all I listened to in high school. I realized I hadn’t listened to The Cure in like five years or something. So: Haiti, Nigeria, and England. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p>",

BLK is infused with fulvic acid, a natural compound popular in alternative medicine, which gives the water its signature black hue. The company was started by two sisters Jacqueline and Louise Wilkie, who believe the drink’s “alkaline fulvic trace” saved their mother’s life. On Wikipedia, “Blackwater” may refer to the private American security consulting firm associated with the 2007 Nisour Square massacre, a liquid waste remaining after coal preparation, and a wastewater containing feces, flushwater and urine from toilets, an acute kidney disease, towns in Australia, Canada, Republic of Ireland, Poland, Romania, United Kingdom, and the United States, and assorted artworks. The Manzo brothers no longer promote BLK water. In 2015, they opened an upscale bar-food restaurant in Hoboken, New Jersey called Little Town Social. Chris Manzo told Nj.com that high class restaurants were in demand in Hoboken. \"It's not a beer and shot town anymore,\" he said. \"It's a place where people want to enjoy themselves.\" In 2016, Chris published his first children’s book, <em>Oliver Brightside: You Don’t Want That Penny. </em>Nevertheless, BLK water and its “alkaline fulvic trace” persist. A pack of 24 16.9 oz BLK bottles costs $50.90 on Amazon.

		"slug" : "interview-yoni-wolf",
		"body" : "<p><em>(Yoni Wolf has been making music since the mid-nineties and has been frontman of the</em><em> band Why? since it formed </em><em>in</em><em> 2004. Why? released the album </em>Moh Lhean<em> in March 2017 and is currently on tour through the US.)</em></p><p><em><br></em></p><p>EE: Hey! Thanks so much for doing this. You’ve started off on tour lately—how’s that going?</p><p><br></p><p>YW: We’ve been on tour for about three weeks now. It’s fine, we have a day off today, so I’m walking around with my lady friend; gonna do some cooking, gonna do some laundry, et cetera.</p><p><br></p><p>EE: We wanted to ask about your latest album, <em>Moh Lhean</em>— is it pronounced Mo Lean?</p><p><br></p><p>YW: That’s fine.</p><p><br></p><p>EE: You’d been on a little hiatus until it came out, right? It’s a lot of new songs — I was wondering if you could tell us a little about what went into it: process, time frame, inspiration…</p><p><br></p><p>YW: Well, we recorded this one at home, so it went on for a while, as things tend to do when you have as much time as you want to work on them. I wrote the first song in 2010 and just sort of had been working on the songs since then, and pieced it together through the course of much time.</p><p><br></p><p>EE: Right! It’s a different creative process altogether when you have as much time as you want to work on something, right? You can move it around until you’re really happy about it.</p><p><br></p><p>YW: Yeah. I mean, eventually you’ll have to set some deadlines, but yeah—we definitely spent some good time on it.</p><p><br></p><p>EE: Well, I’ve been having a great time listening to the album. I know that a lot of reviewers are saying that this feels really mellowed and mature, saying that it’s a contrast with some of your earlier work, that was more intense and emotionally jagged. Do you agree with that; do you think there’s a change going on here?</p><p><br></p><p>YW: Well, it’s hard for me to say, but there does seem to be a break in it: I can only say for myself, as the writer, that I’ve had some developments in my own life, and I think that those have seeped into the music some; I think part of that is an attempt to be a little more acceptant and settled, and less angry or jagged, as you say. So yes, I think that what you’re noticing is there.</p><p><br></p><p>EE: Right! So it’s not so much that you’re deliberately pushing the music in different directions, but you’re changing as a person and artist, which is reflected in your art.</p><p><br></p><p>EE: I’m not a musician, but I am a poet, so I’m really curious about the songwriting process. Do you start with writing lyrics and then write the music? Do you begin with a feeling, with some words—how do you fit the music and lyrics together—how does that process go?</p><p><br></p><p>YW: Usually, I let go and let God, so to speak, in terms of writing the poems. I sort of just try to be in an open state, and usually — I write a lot as I’m falling asleep, or I write when I wake up, or something like that — I don’t have a great routine for writing. But I sort of, if I’m in the right space, I will start to gather up couplets or phrases, and then it begins the long process of constructing and editing and stuff like that, which is more internal. But hopefully the seeds of the things come from something outside of me, or maybe underneath me, in terms of consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>EE: Thank you for explaining that! So your lyrics — they’re very personal. How does it feel to be performing such confessional lyrics?</p><p><br></p><p>YW: Well, in fact this new album is not as confessional as my previous work. To me, this new one is —not quite more universal, since it comes from my life—but to me this new one is less intimate, for me, in a gross way, than some stuff. </p><p><br></p><p>EE: Right! I was wondering, also, about the persona of your songs — whether you invent characters or write autobiographically, or something in between. You didn’t really lose your hand in Chicago! What is your relationship to the persona you take on in your lyrics?</p><p><br></p><p>YW: Well, I mean—just like anyone else, I write things partially from my life, partially from my imagination, partially metaphor— I deploy all those techniques that people use. I’m not writing from a consistent character necessarily; I think that maybe I’ve done that more so in the past, to an extent. I think my album <i><em>Alopecia</em></i>, which came out ten years ago, is more of a weird amplified version of myself that’s this sadsack, dark, brooding, sarcastic, cynical version of myself. On this album I don’t really feel like I’m building a character at all—maybe I am, in some way, but it’s not intentional.</p><p><br></p><p>EE: I was also asked to ask you this next question—as a singer-songwriter, who’s writing poems when you’re writing your lyrics, what was your reaction to Bob Dylan winning the Nobel Prize in Literature?</p><p><br></p><p>YW: Oh, I don’t know—I think it’s warranted! When you have a guy who’s had a career like that, you know, I wouldn’t say that all of his work necessarily works on the page, and I don’t know if that’s a criteria for winning the Nobel Prize for Literature. But there is a good hunk of his work that does sit very well on the page. And I’m all for it.</p><p><br></p><p>EE: So was I! It was exciting news. </p><p><br></p><p>EE: So, I am involved in student radio, and we are pretty divided up by genre. We have the punk and DIY radio department, and the hip-hop-R&B department, and they more or less refuse to overlap. How do you feel about the categorization of your music by genre? Where would you tell us to play this album on the radio—which department should broadcast it?<br></p><p><br></p><p>YW: All of them! I don’t know, I don't think a lot about that stuff. I think it’s pretty archaic to think in terms of genre in those cut-up and defined ways. I think we’re at a point now where everyone listens to every kind of music. I don’t know anyone who thinks of themselves as “I’m a punker” or “I’m a hip-hopper” anymore. When I was growing up, for sure, the black kids listened to rap music and the white kids listened to heavy metal. It’s just not that way anymore. Everyone kind of listens to everything. And most music has a ton of different influences. I think it’s almost disingenuous to say, “We do strictly reggae”, or something; it’s almost a shtick if someone does that. “We’re a punk band”—it’s almost ironic, you know, to be that singular. It’s not realistic.</p><p><br></p><p>EE: That makes a lot of sense. Genres aren’t distinct, they’re all drawing on each other…</p><p><br></p><p>YW: But even beyond that, I think it’s strange — today we were up on a restaurant’s roof patio and they were playing all this 60s soul and R&B — I find it really interesting to consider: what is music, and how did it turn into these three-minute pop songs that we all still kind of do? What is music of the past, from different cultures; what did it mean, what was the purpose of it? And what about music of the future: what will its purpose be? I think, at its purest, it’s always had the same purpose, which is to feed the soul of the human being when you’re playing and when you’re listening to it. Now that it’s monetized it’s really morphed into these little morsels that can be bought and sold. It’s very interesting to think about, for someone like me, being in it.</p><p><br></p><p>EE: Right! There really is no clear reason why the conventions are what they are. </p><p><br></p><p>EE: So <em>Moh Lhean</em> just came out, and you’re on tour — are you working on any new songs? Or is it too early to think about next steps?</p><p><br></p><p>YW: I’ve got some stuff I’ve been working on, parallel to <em>Moh Lhean</em>, so I imagine I’ll get back into that at some point, though I haven’t really had time lately. When I’ve got some time off I’ll reevaluate what I have been working on, and go from there.</p><p><br></p><p>EE: That sounds great! I don’t want to hold you up much longer, but was wondering—what should we expect to hear when you come through Boston? Old stuff, new stuff, all of it?</p><p><br></p><p>YW: All of it! We play a lot from the new record, a lot of stuff from albums past—it’s a good mix.</p><p><br></p><p>EE: I’ll be there! Thank you again for joining us.</p>",

		"slug" : "ReviewMen_Without_Women_by_Haruki_Murakami",
		"body" : "<p><i>Men Without Women</i></p><p>            By Haruki Murakami<br></p><p>            Translated from the Japanese by Philip Gabriel and Ted Goossen</p><p>            228 pp. New York:</p><p>            Alfred A. Knopf. $25.95 </p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/media/tmp/MenWithoutWomen.jpg\" style=\"width: 738px; height: 382px;\" width=\"738\" height=\"382\"><br></p><p><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span></span>In his new book <em>Men Without Women</em><i>, </i>Haruki Murakami tells the stories of seven heartbroken men to explore the condition of solitude—of being a Men Without Women, which the titular story insists is “always a relentlessly frigid plural.” The fidelity of the stories to this central theme is tight and precise, giving the collection an overall feel similar to one of the “days” in the <em>Decameron</em>—if, instead of the plague-ridden Italian countryside, the aching lovers roamed across Murakami’s melancholic Tokyo.            </p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\" rel=\"text-align: justify;\">In Murakami’s treatment, solitude emerges as a chronic condition whose incurability stifles the possibility of action. The reader quickly learns that the universe in which these stories take place is not one in which it is possible to recover your lost beloved—and not because they have fallen down a dark, bottomless well. In <em>Men Without Women</em><i>, </i>the causes of solitude are considerably more prosaic: death, adultery, the natural progression of time. With no other recourse the protagonists in this collection forgo action in favor of simply telling their stories. </p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Indeed, one of the first things a reader will notice about this collection is how much of the action is related secondhand. There’s very little direct narration; instead, the protagonists relate their past sorrows in retrospect to whoever happens to be listening. Hence in “Drive My Car” the melancholic stage actor Kafuku tells the story of how he befriended the man who cuckolded him to his homely driver, Misaki. Similarly, in “Scheherazade,” Habara’s mysterious middle-aged housekeeper unravels the story of her amorous teenage burglary to him in parts. In “An Independent Organ,” the story of Dr. Tokai’s fatal tryst with a woman sixteen years younger is told through his writer friend Mr. Tanimura. And in “Yesterday,” the unconsummated relationship between the oddball Kitaru and his long term girlfriend Erika is recalled from the perspective of a young literature student at Waseda, who was himself caught in their dispassionate love triangle.</p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The sense of temporal and emotional distance evoked by these narrative strategies suggests that the primary preoccupations of this collection stem not from how heartbreak is experienced, but rather how it is <i>re-lived</i>. Indeed, the notion of passionate, physical love is completely absent from the collection: “In the face of such an amazing girl how could I even think of having a sordid hard-on?” asks the narrator of the titular story. </p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The retrospective impulse that pervades the collection is a clear throwback to Murakami’s s hit 1987 novel <em>Norwegian Wood</em><i>, </i>which begins with the narrator Toru’s straightforward declaration that he is writing the novel only to better preserve his rapidly fading memories of past love. In <em>Men Without Women</em><i>, </i>the preoccupation of memory takes on a bit of a neurotic bent, which is not surprising since emotional or physical anomalies lie at the center of so many of these stories. “I want to understand,” says Kafuku, the protagonist of “Drive My Car:” “There was something inside her, something important, that I must have missed…a small, locked safe lying at the bottom of the ocean.”</p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The parallel to <em>Norwegian Wood</em> runs deeper. <i><em>Men Without Women</em> </i>forgoes the absurdist flavor of many of Murakami’s earlier short stories like “Superfrog Saves Tokyo” and “The Second Bakery Attack” in favor of a somber emotional realism that distinctively recalls the nostalgic tone of <i><em>Norwegian Wood</em></i>. Fans eager for more dark, bottomless wells and talking cats are sure to be disappointed (though there is a strange concept of animal reincarnation that recurs frequently). Unfortunately, however, the sum impression of these stories never quite reaches the emotional pitch achieved in <i>Norwegian Wood. </i>The excessive amount of chronic narration and backstory weigh down the stories’ momentum and give them a monotonic feel. Many of the images that the stories lean heavily on fall flat, and most of the stories themselves seem to end without going anywhere. Perhaps somewhat fittingly, <em>Men Without Women</em> leaves much to be desired.</p>",

Pyrotechnics and massive screens began to roll as he transitioned into yet another immensely catchy and soulful song from his hit-studded repertoire. In front of the stage, beach balls flew and a sea of arms glistening with wristbands bobbed slightly off beat. All eyes focused on Chance. As he ran and jumped across the stage, it was hard not to revel at his fervor and knack for crowd engagement. But if college has taught me anything, it is to immediately transform my natural revelry into analytical impetus. And as a Religious Studies major, I couldn’t help but take a step back to look at the precedent and undertones of Chance’s massive performance.<br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wickedly clever lyrics, a distinctive cross between rapping and singing, and one of the most memorable ad-libs to date <strong>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tzhgwCmL3Q\"><u>Ahh</u></a>) </strong>have brought the independent recording artist Chancelor Bennett into the public eye. First breaking through with his mixtape “Acid Rap,” Chance has built an organic following and a unique sound, culminating in his most recent mixtape, “Coloring Book,” which, in 2016, became the first streaming-only album to ever win a Grammy. With titles such as “Angels,” and “Blessings,” this album is laden with Black church influences, most obviously the gospel choir that is featured on nearly every song and album credits to gospel legend Kirk Franklin. At Boston Calling it became clear that Chance was continuing to draw from these influences in his live performances--again backed by a choir and a live band of former church musicians--a very rare occurrence in a rap world dominated by DJs. In between each song, there were church-like interludes where he would speak on themes of spiritual fulfillment, personal growth, and even the afterlife. (see first quote)</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"blob:http://theharvardadvocate.com/5f34d8d3-326c-4185-bf5e-293ccb3652d4\" \"=\"\" width=\"692\" height=\"360\" style=\"width: 692px; height: 360px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\" rel=\"text-align: justify;\"> Once I started to notice these religious themes in Chance’s performance, they became hard to avoid. His raspy half-rap/half-singing voice became reminiscent of a preacher’s growl, his lyrical content seemed intentionally broad and uplifting, the imagery projected on screens behind him taking on an iconic quality. And by far the most popular item at the entire festival (even more than the seemingly endless $8 Miller Lite cans) was Chance’s signature “3” hat. It could be spotted on festival-goers at every setting from the Mumford & Sons crowd to the press tent. With an extremely simple design--the number 3 in white on a dark background--the hat almost felt like a mark of membership to the “church” of Chance--the wearer immediately identifiable as hip to Chance’s style and message.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It seems to be a stretch to call Chance a Christian rapper since he has achieved so much success beyond Christian people and communities. But taking his recent musical choices into account--both in his last album and megachurch-inspired performances--perhaps we should reconsider this categorization. I hesitate to use the word “appropriative” to describe Chance’s act since he himself is a Christian, but the fact that I and countless other Chance fans, religious or otherwise, continue to sing along to his catchy tunes without really processing its deeply Christian content and style is something to think about.</p>",

When I saw the band open for Stone Temple Pilots in 2010, I was one of the fifteen audience members who knew the words and stood by the stage. The hundreds of seated attendees who had never heard of the opener could see that I was a real fan.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With every step the band took toward mainstream success, I tried to claim them as my own. I broadcasted my excitement for Cage the Elephant releases on Facebook (Figure 1). I refused to take pictures on my flip phone after their concert, fearing I might somehow replace my home-screen photo of lead singer Matt Schultz jumping into the audience.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When I heard the single from their 2013 album <i>Melophobia</i> inside an elevator, I knew I had to accept that Cage the Elephant was popular. Though I had carried my copy of <i>Thank You Happy Birthday</i> everywhere I went on the day of its release in 2011, I couldn’t even be bothered to click through <i>Melophobia </i>on YouTube. Cage the Elephant’s indie-ness wasn’t gonna to cut it if I wanted my friends to think I was a real music person.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This put me in a complicated position when I ran into Matt Schultz by the press tent porta-potties at Boston Calling 2017. Cage the Elephant’s set that day had reminded me how disconnected I was from their music. When the band began their closer, a wall of cell phones went up in front of me to Snapchat-story a song I had never heard before.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Talking to Matt Schultz, I struggled to hide the four-year gap in my Cage the Elephant knowledge. Instead of asking Nardwuar-style deep cuts, I forgot everything I had learned from Noisey’s “Here Are the Shitty Interview Questions You Should Never Ask a Band” article. I spent the next four hours beating myself up over things I could have said to prove to Matt that I was different than the other fans—I was there from the beginning (Figure 2).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Near the end of Tool’s headlining set that night, I decided to leave so I could avoid the crowd that would swarm the square when the festival finished. During the ten minutes I spent pushing my way out of the audience, three different bearded bald men wearing white tank tops each said something along the lines of, “Here’s a real fan—he hears <u><i>insert unfamiliar song title</i></u> and leaves.”</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wasn’t offended, because it was generous of them to assume I knew any Tool songs at all, and I was relieved to see that every band had snobby fans like me. I left Boston Calling wondering what it is about alternative music and that encourages this kind of competition, and more importantly, how I could show people I’m realer than that.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Figure 1:</p><p><img src=\"/media/tmp/harvard-%20advocate-%20boston%20calling%202017%20piece-%20status%201.jpg\"></p><p><img src=\"/media/tmp/harvard-%20advocate-%20boston%20calling%202017%20piece-%20status%202.jpg\"></p><p><img src=\"/media/tmp/harvard-%20advocate-%20boston%20calling%202017%20piece-%20status%203.jpg\"></p><p><img src=\"/media/tmp/harvard-%20advocate-%20boston%20calling%202017%20piece-%20status%204.jpg\"></p><p><img src=\"/media/tmp/harvard-%20advocate-%20boston%20calling%202017%20piece-%20status%205.jpg\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\" rel=\"text-align: justify;\">I know these are rough.

		"slug" : "aninterviewwithjddaniels",
		"body" : "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">J.D. Daniels’ writing has provoked a response that only a unique talent could. In both praise and criticism of Daniels’ recently published first collection, <i>The Correspondence</i>, there exists a common tone: a sort of <i>what the hell is this? </i>It’s a confusion that fresh style demands – a confrontation with the sheen of the new.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i></i></p>      <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Daniels manages to marry registers that might sound contradictory, but, in his hands, appear natural: bravura and vulnerability, academic erudition and folk wisdom, humor and frankness. And this wealth of material somehow finds the space to rattle around in a tightly bound, rhythmic prose. His essays take the liberty to chase ideas and often become something that they once weren’t in the span of just a sentence. It’s a thrilling agility. To read him can be like watching a brain at work. His writing bears the markings of an exciting new voice in American nonfiction.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On a rainy April morning, Nica Franklin and I met Daniels at The Advocate in between commitments. He had just returned home to Cambridge following a trip to New York for the <i>Paris Review </i>Revel and was on the way to London to promote the UK publication of <i>The Correspondence</i>. The following interview comes from our conversation that morning, condensed and edited for clarity. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I found Daniels to be unmistakably the writer of his own work, which is to say his personality mirrors many of its charms. He’s gracious, self-effacing, full of energy, and bursting with ideas. The <i>Advocate</i> thanks him for his time and good spirit.<em></em></p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- </em>Matthew Browne</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i></i></p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: </i><i>How was this Paris Review party?</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: The New York guys all know each other. But I can’t pretend that I’m a hick any more. I feel sorry for myself for ten minutes and pretend I don’t know anybody, but then I say, “Oh, hey, Dan! — Hey, Bobby!” — My make-believe act has worn out.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: When you talk about pretending to be a hick, is that playing up being from Kentucky?</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: To them, <i>Boston</i> is the back woods. A city with training wheels. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I’m in New York and I’m sitting next to Todd Solondz. I don’t know who this guy is. He makes movies. He wears clothes that alert you to the fact that he’s <i>an artist.</i> But he was swell and he asked me about Kentucky. He said he’d driven through Kentucky. He said, “We stopped and we got out at a gas station and my friend and I just started laughing. We started laughing.” He said it was because the accent is so beautiful. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: Do you find that everyone wants to talk to you about Kentucky?</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: No one wants to talk to me about anything. There is no “everyone wants to talk to me.”</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: When you’re at a big literary party in New York and say that you’re from Kentucky, are people fascinated by it?</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: My literary New York never gets as far as, “Where are you from?” You open your mouth, and they see somebody more important than you over your shoulder, and they split. New York is a difficult place for them to live. Their social lives become instrumentalized. Nobody can just chill and exchange emotions. They got shit they have to <i>do</i>. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">People get nervous at these parties. It’s a giant room. I’m walking around, and I walked into the corner, and I was looking at everybody. I told myself, “The real writer stands in the corner.” And then I thought, “John, that’s a defense you can use in many other places in your life, but at the <i>Paris Review</i> Revel, you are not the only writer in the room.” And as if someone had lifted the blinds, I look around, and what do I see? I see forty-two writers standing in different corners.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: There’s not enough corner space for everyone.</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: That’s right. There needs to be, like, a dodecagon.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: One reason I keep asking you about Kentucky is I’m interested in how you play with American idiom in the book. At least in my reading of it, you take idiom from a pretty slant angle, where you’ll kind of move into it, be making fun of it, playing around with it, using these sort of borrowed folk terms. In this way, or others, has the color of the language in Kentucky painted your writing?</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: My mother was one of seven children born to a tenant farmer. They didn’t own the land. They were itinerant. Dirt floor, dress made out of a potato sack. But my mother worked hard to send me to a glitzy private school for five years. Then we couldn’t afford it any more, and I went to school in the Jackson Street housing projects. And next to a nice high school, a magnet school for math and science.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What might make somebody alert to language would be always moving in and out of non-overlapping language circles. Not trying to pass, exactly. I would say insisting on <i>not</i> passing. I <i>can</i> talk the appropriate language, but I want to talk the <i>wrong</i> language depending on where I am, which is just a species of pride: “I don’t belong here, I’m special.” And that’s crazy. Nobody’s that special. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: Are you thinking about this a lot or is that just something I’m imposing on you – this thing about moving through different language spheres and feeling cognizant of place because of them?</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: Somewhere Borges says: You don’t have to do anything to be contemporary, you are your own contemporary. You don’t have to try to be up-to-date, whatever you do is up-to-date. This is my Kentucky accent, even if it doesn’t match with whatever Todd Solondz thinks it ought to be. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don’t think other people care about it. I’m the one who cares about it. I’m self-conscious. I’m trying to hold myself together and not shatter. You guys are in the writing business. You know that you have to be able to take in emotional information, which can be overwhelming. And then you have to be able to block out emotional information, without slamming down a bunch of portcullises. The ideal would be a flexible, semi-permeable membrane, but that’s not what it’s like. It’s more like being a skinned knee, and the air stings.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: What kind of stuff do you think you have to block out?</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: You have to block out the stuff that’s loud enough and bright enough that it makes you want to scream in pain. Everybody’s in pain. It’s not special. If I think a sound is loud and it bothers me, and then I scream in pain, isn’t the sound of my scream itself loud enough that it will bother somebody else? I don’t want to play emotional freeze-tag with my distress: “Oh, this hurts me — here, you take it.” But at the same time, I can’t lie down on my emotions like a martyr on a grenade: “All right, the buck stops here — everybody else can feel great, but I’m going to feel like a dog turd all the time.” That won’t help.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: It sounds like you’re saying that it’s a question of craft. Do you block out certain stuff because it’s better writing or do you block out certain stuff because it feels like there’s a personal emotional imperative?</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: You can do more with less, but you can’t do anything with nothing. Did you ever read one of these books where the guy <i>missed?</i> He wanted to think that less was more, but he left <i>everything</i> out. He <i>omitted the body of the letter.</i> I want writing to be compressed. I try to value other people’s time. It’s a balancing act. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On one end, you have someone who seems merely to be vomiting. Great whopping doorstopper books. There may be value in them, but it’s distributed thinly through a huge diluted soup. Vomit soup! </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But on the other end, you have aphorists like Cioran or La Rochefoucauld where it’s painfully dense. You want to say to the guy, “Hey, relax. How about some sentences like: <i>I opened the door</i>.” It can’t all be diamond-hard poetry. It’s too intense. It makes people feel tense to read it. You ever see a movie called <i>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</i>? Doesn’t he say, about his friend Cameron, that if you stuck a lump of coal up his ass he would shit a diamond? Have you ever read a book that felt like that? </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the one hand, you have Vollmann. An impressive guy, but it’s verbal diarrhea. He didn’t take any trouble. Here are the ingredients, now you make the dinner. Diarrhea for dinner! That is not courteous. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, you have writers who are clenched up too tight, and it’s communicated to the reader. It’s emotionally contagious. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But when I look at the world, I mainly see my own brain circuitry. These are <i>my</i> problems, as a writer and as a man: prolixity or aphorism, overwhelming or withholding.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: I like that. It’s interesting to think of it in a matter of manners, that the reader is engaged in a relationship of time with you and that requires hospitality. You don’t want to be rude to them, in a way.</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: You don’t want to be rude to them, and you don’t want to pretend they don’t exist. There are all kinds of people, and there are all kinds of relationships. People like to get peed on, and it’s fine. But I don’t like to get peed on, and I don’t want to pee on other people. I want to be cognizant that someone else is reading this, that someone else is doing half the work. We’re doing it together. It’s a relationship. Even in the most abusive relationship, the abuser needs <i>someone else</i>. You don’t do it alone. Maybe other people don’t think reading and writing is a relationship. But that’s what I think it is.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: You conceive of the book as a collection of letters. It’s called The Correspondence. You have the Burroughs epigraph (“Maybe the real novel is letters to you.”) It makes sense to me why you would want to think of an essay as a letter if you’re thinking about writing as a relationship. Why do you think it’s important to call them letters and what do you think the function of conceiving an essay as a letter is?</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: I love this word “conceiving” that you’re spontaneously saying, because that’s the precise distinction I want to draw. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If I say I don’t like big, loose, shitty books, that’s not a casual way of cursing. Hanna Segal says there can be an immature creative relationship to your own art, which is: <i>I made this by myself</i>. What can I make by myself? If I look at my body and the rules for consciousness in mammals, what I can make by myself is: <i>a piece of shit</i>. That’s what I can make. But it’s a piece of shit. It’s not <i>alive</i>. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If I want my art to be alive — like <i>Young Frankenstein</i>: “Give my creation life!” — what’s my biological model for that in my body? It’s a relationship, a sexual relationship. Or, as you say, “conceive.” Something that is alive, that will outlive us both, that’s a result of our relationship. Not just me, sitting there alone and pooping.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As far as calling them <i>letters</i>, this is what happened. The first one is called “Letter from Cambridge.” <i>The Paris Review</i> has a tradition of letters from abroad, and Lorin thought it would be a surprising title. First, it’s not from abroad. Second, when people think of Cambridge, Massachusetts, I don’t think they think of me rolling around on the ground with a bunch of sweaty bricklayers, getting elbowed in the face. It was this fun system of expectation and surprise, and they could close the magazine with it, which is a flattering point of emphasis. Didn’t Richard Pryor say that? He said: I only remember two times I had sex, the first time and the last time. It’s great to be the last piece in the magazine. That was “Letter from Cambridge.” </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Letter from Majorca” had many titles. Lorin said: We should call it “Letter from Majorca.”</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Letter from Level Four” was published as “Empathy” in the magazine, but I changed it when we re-wrote it for the book, because I was starting to have an idea that the book would be called <i>The Correspondence</i>. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Likewise, “Letter from Devils Tower” was called “Close Encounters,” I think, in the magazine. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And “Letter from the Primal Horde” was “The Selected Correspondence of Charles Masterson.” I was really far out when I started that one, but soon it became clear what I had to call it.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I love to read books of people’s letters, even from writers that I can’t stand, like William Gaddis, whom I admire but can’t stand. But I read his letters, and those were marvelous. It’s a way to get through my envy, and my hate, and all the things that block my appreciation. I think, “Oh, I can’t read this novel.” And then I think, “I don’t know, it can’t be that bad. Everybody else is wrong and I’m right? That’s unlikely.” How can I have a relationship with this important American writer? I know: I’ll read something more intimate. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>NF: Going back to this idea of the relationship between the text and the reader, the author and the reader, I was really taken by the idiomatic language that you’re using. It seems like an idiom is a way that you can forge a bond between you and who’s reading the book by making something accessible in a way that other things can’t because it’s like a private language that, if you both know it, you can both enter a space. </i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: Right.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>NF: I don’t know if you think this has any intentional connection to the idea of a letter being from somewhere. It has an origination. And if you and the reader can both go to the place where it’s from, through these Kentuckian idioms, these Cambridge/Boston idioms, you can bring someone inside almost.</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: Listen. There was an article in the <i>New Yorker</i> last week. Emily Nussbaum was writing about a show called <i>Riverdale</i>. My girlfriend read a paragraph aloud and said, “I don’t understand anything in this paragraph.” But what confused her didn’t seem to me that obscure. It was “they roofie a football player” and “cosplay.” She said, “What is <i>cosplay</i>?” I said, “If you don’t know, guess. They’re dressed up. What do you think it is?” Then it was “tart-tongued bestie.” She said, “What is a <i>bestie</i>?” I said, “What do you think it is?” She said, “It must be her best friend.” I said, “If you understand it, then what are you mad about? You’re mad that this girl isn’t talking <i>to you</i>.” </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It’s what you just said about idiom and how it makes a shared space, if it does. I think what was upsetting my girlfriend was: Nussbaum is right in front of her, writing ostensibly to her — you know, if you have a subscription to the magazine, it’s for you — and yet Nussbaum is obviously <i>not</i> talking to <i>her</i>. The writer has made this language-world that, as you say, can either bring us in or shut us out.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>NF: I think that’s something interesting that you’re doing in this book. Often there are these idioms that will bring me in and it’s a language that I understand, but there are also times where there are things that I don’t understand. Sometimes you use the “you” or the “your” in a way that makes me feel implicated even when I have almost no idea, like it’s another language. For example, in Letter From Kentucky, you say, “I lost a lot of money shooting nine-ball in that bar. Listen to your uncle Tim-Tom and never play pool for money against a man called Doc.” And I don’t know what it is about this sentence, maybe it’s the “you,” which is somehow a “me” but also a reader.</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: “You” is the most interesting pronoun. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: You mention having this window into thinking about yourself and your own writing through psychoanalysis. How do you see that playing out in your writing? </i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: I used to be a different person. I’ve taken a lot of drugs and it can ramp up certain kinds of awareness while … Listen, did you ever go to a loud rock concert? You know it can give you hearing damage? You are privy to an intense experience that informs you … but at the same time, it damages your ability to hear anything else <i>for the rest of your life</i>. Hallucinogenic drugs can be like that. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Somewhere Robert Fripp says about Jimi Hendrix — I am neither Robert Fripp nor Jimi Hendrix — but Fripp says an electrical analogy is exact. If you’re gonna drive <i>X</i> number of volts through this device, you need a circuit-breaker. Fripp’s argument is, there can be guys like, say, Charlie Parker — and I’m not Charlie Parker, either — who are capable of receiving more data than they can process, or even endure. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Part of what interpretation is in psychoanalysis is: excluding data. If you bring in <i>everything</i>, it’s impossible to make a meaningful statement. It’s like what we said about compression in writing. It’s about sacrifice. You can’t say it all.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That’s what interpretation is about. It’s clarification for the other person. I say, “ABCDEFG,” and the other person says, “D.” He’s not instructing me. He’s helping me follow lines and narrow things down. It’s about leaving things out.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: I think Freud has been so important to writers for almost 100 years now because the tools of psychoanalysis have so many valences with what writing is and what narrative and storytelling is: being engaged in a conversation, exposing, like you say, “data” about your life and your story and trying to find out which story you want to draw out of it. How you want to understand yourself, how you want to understand the events of your past that lead you to be a certain way.</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: Or the plain fact that you <i>don’t</i> want to understand. Like O’Connor’s Misfit says to the Grandmother, “It would have been better for all of you, lady, if you hadn’t of reckernized me.” — Or, as the Shepherd says in <i>Oedipus Rex</i>, “Oh, God, what for? What more do you want to know? … In God’s name, master, don’t ask any more questions.”</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I read less and less Freud and more Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel, Melanie Klein, Hanna Segal, Karen Horney. This guy named Fred Alford, who isn’t even a psychoanalyst but just appears to be a natural, he writes about politics and government at some university in Maryland, I think he is a world-beating genius. Pierre Bayard, who’s an interesting cat but readers don’t take him seriously because he’s funny. But that is exactly what makes him serious: truth is a grace that flees from solemn effort. Solemnity is not seriousness. We were talking about aphorism earlier. Bayard is not an aphorist like Schopenhauer, bringing the hammer down. It seems like nothing is happening, but later it sinks in. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The last thing I want to say about this is that it’s impossible to talk about analysis and not make a fool out of myself, because psychoanalysis is a discipline of listening, not talking.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: The thing you mention about seriousness not being solemnity – that people are wont not to take a person seriously because he’s funny – makes me think of your writing. I wanted to ask you about the role of humor in your writing. It reminds me a lot of Zizek, actually, like when he explains a philosophical concept through a Marx Brothers’ joke. He thinks that humor does this thing of truth revealing that best explains a complicated, dialectic issue. It seems to me that humor functions like this in your writing. I don’t want to say too much because I feel like I’m already talking words around this, but the idea of not wanting to punish the reader connects to this as well. In thinking about writing as a letter, to be funny is to bring the reader in closer to you, to offer something.</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: I think part of the reason I’m cognizant of “not wanting to punish the reader” is because I <i>do</i> want to punish the reader. Everybody’s got problems and, if we have a relationship, our problems are going to intersect. I want to punish the reader, but I must not do that. That’s a treat I’m not going to give myself. I didn’t enjoy being treated like that, and I’m not going to treat someone else like that. Humor can be a mode of aggression. That’s why it’s called a punch line. It’s a way to transform a wish to punish the reader into something else. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: I’m thinking of certain jokes that I remember from the book. For example, in the beginning of that Letter From Cambridge essay, there’s that bit: “A couple of years ago I joined one of those clubs where they teach you how to knock the shit out of other people. The first lesson is how to get the shit knocked out of yourself. The first lesson is all there is. It lasts between eighty and a hundred years, depending on your initial shit content.” Having heard what you just said, I think it’s a joke, but it doesn’t strike me to work the way that a joke often does. It’s funny to me because it seems quite true. It seems now like truth telling. But you intend to be funny, right? You intend to be telling jokes?</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: Not all the time. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Letter from Cambridge” was originally about Kafka. This guy Dave, a cop from Somerville, said to me, “Do you really teach literature?” I said, “Yeah.” And he said, “I never was good at literature in school. What is that thing literature is about again?” I said, “What?” He said, “You know like in <i>Don Quijote</i>, or in Kafka. What is that thing literature is about, again?” This is what Dave said to me while he was knocking the shit out of me. You don’t think a <i>cop</i> can fight? He knows all these compliance holds, and he gets a lot of practice. I wrote this thing about Dave and Kafka, then I went back and left the Kafka out. I didn’t tell a joke on purpose. When you and I look back on it today, we’re trying to dignify it with some sort of theoretical underpinning. You know, you can surprise yourself. You don’t know what you’ll say. Other things you plan. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Letter from Cambridge” is not really about fighting, and how could it be? I’m no expert. I started when I was in my thirties. Writing is something you can get better at as you get older, but fighting is not like that. I dove in just in time, and I had ten exciting years. I was a below-average fighter. That’s where <i>average</i> comes from: some people are above average, and other people are below average. I was below average. If I had worked a lot harder, I could have gotten a little better. But one day you look up and say, “I’m fighting a guy twenty years younger than I am. What am I doing?” <i></i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: Have you come up with an answer to when you stepped back and asked yourself why you were fighting these guys 20 years younger than you – well, I guess you say the piece isn’t about fighting – but have you come up with a satisfying answer about why you wanted to be fighting in this organized manner?</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: I love my life here, but it’s more high-toned than what I was used to. I’ve been living with the same woman for more than ten years. My girlfriend’s father used to work in the White House. He was at Harvard. He was at MIT. — Sport-fighting was a doorway back into what my life used to be like. It was rougher. I was wrestling that guy from twenty years ago.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And fighting was also a relief from <i>language</i>. I read an article by an analyst in California named Randall Sokoloff who wrote about my “Letter From Majorca.” Sokoloff pointed to this part in my essay, about the incomprehensible: “I was free from the obligation to apprehend and interpret. If I don’t understand what you want from me, I don’t have to try to do it, I can’t. The sea is incomprehensible and uncomprehending, the sea doesn’t care, which is terrific, depending on what kind of <i>care</i> you are accustomed to receiving … If anyone wanted something from me on that boat, he said my name. If no one said my name, I was not wanted. And <i>I was not wanted</i>, I floated for a month in a sea of unmeaning noise, I was free from the horror of being deformed by another person’s needs and desires.”</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What Sokoloff said — although now I’m quoting Christopher Bollas, who himself was quoting Winnicott — is that you can build a hyper-adapted language-self for doing business with other people, but is that really <i>you</i>? Language is a tool for adapting to the reality of other people. But you have another self that <i>isn’t </i>comprehensible, that hasn’t adapted to other people, that doesn’t make the sacrifices that adapting to other people requires. Or it does, but it resents them and it’s deformed, or it lets go with nine fingers but it holds on with one finger. — Bion wrote a novel called<i> Memoirs from the Future</i> and it’s totally incomprehensible. And, at the end, he says “I know that this book is incomprehensible, but since I have spent my entire professional life trying to comprehend other people and make myself comprehensible to them, please indulge me in a brief respite from making sense — my own moment of being incomprehensible.” </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: I obviously already see then the connections between how we’ve been talking about writing this whole time as this sort of relationship. Fighting is a relationship of a different sort too. And it seems like it actually has kind of the opposite effect, in a way, of what we were talking about writing having. One the goal is to punish another person and the other, in your understanding, the goal is to connect, not punish. I think you even recognize this at one point within the piece where you say that – I forget the exact quote, but you say something about how every fight is a story. It’s also one that escapes from language in a way that seems to be satisfying to you. You’re so used to being caught up in these words. The way that you tell stories through words, or the way that you connect to people, form relationships, is through words. This is a relationship not built on words. This is a relationship not built on responsibilities towards equitable treatment of other people. It’s a relationship in the way that you seem to conceive of relationships in your writing, but it eschews all these other standards of propriety.</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: Coach Costa told me, “David, we’re all here to fight. You are here to fight. The other guy is here to fight. You’re not doing anybody any favors by holding back.” I’m not doing myself any favors by training myself to be reticent. Part of what I’m doing is protecting myself from the knowledge that even my best effort might not be effective. I’m trying to tell myself, “Oh, don’t hurt the other person. Be decent.” But I’m living in a fantasy world where, if I tried, I <i>could</i> hurt the other person, which ain’t necessarily so. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This business about <i>how to get the shit knocked out</i> of yourself, to say <i>I wanted to</i> <i>beat the shit out</i> of somebody or else <i>I wanted the shit beaten out</i> of me, it’s an infantile creative metaphor. I want to make the shit come out. Why won’t it come out? It seems to me, in the light of what we’ve been saying to each other today, that the reason this model of creativity doesn’t work is because <i>that’s not how it works</i>. Instead, it’s a <i>relationship</i>. There’s always going to be an infantile trace of solo shitting-as-creativity. It’s fundamental. It’s permanent. But it’s not complete or accurate.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The most meaningful criticism I got on this book so far came from when it was published in the UK. The guy said it’s smart, it’s interesting, it’s very very male. I thought, “That’s great, because I am a boy.” But then he said, “If I say that it’s <i>exhaustingly</i> male, maybe you’ll understand what I mean.” I thought, “That is a good criticism.” Just like you don’t have to try to be contemporary, I don’t have to try to be male. It’s a sign of a lack of security. A volleyball, you have to keep hitting it up in the air, because it keeps falling. A bird, you don’t have to keep throwing it in the air. It can fly.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: Why does identifying a masculine bent in your writing strike you as such a powerful criticism?</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: My first thought was: if he thinks it’s exhausting, he’s only reading a book, which is a voluntary action. He should try to <i>be</i> me. I’m exhausted. I am exhausted by my own behavior. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My mother was an English teacher and my father was a cornpone hard-ass. And my father’s language was rich and beautiful, and he was such a genius storyteller that, if they had ever had a kid, it would have been me. It’s perfect. When I was still teaching, I felt tense and self-conscious about having taken my mother’s profession, rather than my father’s. But I worked with my father down at the factory, down at the plant, and he didn’t enjoy his job, and I didn’t enjoy his job. No one could enjoy that job. What I enjoyed was the pleasure of being like my father, which is a fundamental dream for a certain kind of little boy to have. But it contained this paradox: <i>he</i> didn’t want that job, so for <i>me</i> to have it meant <i>not</i> wanting to have it, which is very push-me-pull-you. The last time I went to visit my father in Florida, there was this parade of people coming by to kiss the ring. My dad is the Godfather. He had done something for them, or they wanted to ask him to do something for them. He is an amazing man. But it’s exhausting to know that man and to love him, and it’s exhausting to want to grow up to be him. So I felt like that English reviewer had my number.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: Did you ever have a response for Dave the cop when he asked you what is that thing literature was about?</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: I think he was just fucking with me.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: Yeah. You said you were teaching creative writing?</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: I taught comp, here you call it expository writing. And I taught literature and creative writing, too, at the University of Louisville, and at Boston University, and at a school here called Lesley.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: I suppose you must have at least some sort of pedagogical perspective from that. When you teach, do you have any sense of something that you want to impart? What do you think the point of it is then?</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: The reason I had to quit teaching is: it gave me the habit of believing I had a captive audience, which is an extremely unattractive characteristic. If you get paid to lecture people, soon you will build a habit of lecturing people, which is not suitable for peer-to-peer relationships in the rest of your life. I thought, “I am becoming a deformed, disgusting person. I must take some small steps to remedy that.” The structural problem with teaching is: who becomes a teacher? A good student. But the qualities that make a good student are not the qualities that make a good teacher. Not at all. Being a good teacher is about letting the students be good students. Not about the teacher standing at a podium, being provey and try-hard.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>MB: You say that in the “Letter From Cambridge” essay also. You used to think writing was about something else, then you met enough writers and found out it was about pontificating. I see a reticence to not be that way across the spectrum.</i></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JD: I know a great man named Francis Bator. Francis is a distinguished old man, and he has said many times, “I wish in every school of journalism they would teach a class. It would meet every day for an hour, and they would practice looking in a mirror and saying, ‘I am not qualified to hold an opinion on that subject.’” Life is noisy. Like most writers, I love the sound of my own voice. I’m drunk on my own blood — but oh my God, man, I got to leave some space for other people. I don’t even know that much about the subjects that I care about, and I’ve been studying them for my whole life. What about all the topics I <i>don’t</i> know anything about? If I had known what writing was, I would have made other decisions. But it’s too late now. Maybe I have an exalted idea of the sort of authority you need to say something about the EPA. I wouldn’t feel qualified to talk about that. There must be a thousand people who know more about the environment than I do. They should talk about it. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dwight Garner said my book is so short. But my father used to say, “Don’t tell them everything you know, Johnny. You aren’t going to like how little time it takes you.”</p>",

Movies that satirized, maligned, or celebrated the exploits of the veiled “masters of the universe” became incredibly popular. Hollywood had found its new villain, and the following years saw the release of a string of movies like <em>Margin Call</em><i> </i>(2011), <em>Too Big to Fail</em><i> </i>(2011), and <em>The Big Short</em><i> </i>(2015).<br></p><p><em></em></p>  <p>            Steve James’s new documentary, <em>Abacus: Small Enough to Jail</em>,<i> </i>might be described as the anti-<em>Big Short.</em> It refuses to play into the tropes and excesses of its precursors. For one, it makes no attempt to glamorize the work of bankers or bamboozle the viewer into dumb awe with a barrage of inscrutable technical terms—CDS’s, MBS’s, tranches, and the like. Instead, the only source of the fantastic comes from the film’s very premise: <i><em>Abacus</em> </i>is a profile of the only bank to have been criminally charged with mortgage fraud in the wake of 2008, and the family behind its operations. Only problem is, the bank in question, Abacus Federal Savings Bank, is no Goldman Sachs or Citigroup; it’s actually a small, family-owned bank that serves the mostly Cantonese-speaking immigrant community of New York Chinatown. And the family behind it—the Sung’s—are the furthest thing from faceless Rothschilds. They are, in a word, the bankers-next-door; the nicest financiers you’ll ever meet, <i>two generations </i>of whom have dedicated their lives to serving their community. Two questions, then, surface at the beginning of the film: firstly, given that these people are bankers, how can they be likable (and I mean genuinely likable, not in a love-to-hate kind of way); and secondly, if they are indeed such nice people, how on earth did they get into so much trouble? </p>  <p>             The documentary wastes no time in getting to the first question. It opens with a few scenes from the classic 1946 Christmas film <em>It's a Wonderful Life</em><i>, </i>which is one of those movies that everyone dimly remembers from childhood. In a nutshell, <i><em>It's a Wonderful Life</em> </i>tells the story of a good banker—a selfless small-town man named George Bailey, who, despite having dedicated his entire life to serving his community of Bedford Falls, nonetheless finds himself at the brink of suicide on Christmas Eve. The problem is, George has fallen victim to a conspiracy laid by a powerful man in town aimed at destroying the fiduciary credibility of his bank. Luckily, he has a guardian angel (does the name Clarence Oldbody ring a bell?) tasked to saving him, and in the end, both man and bank are redeemed. </p>  <p>            <i><em>Abacus</em> </i>finds its own George Bailey figure in the enigmatic Thomas Sung, patriarch of the Sung family and pillar of his community. Here is a man of few words, who emigrated to New York from Shanghai in his early teens; settled in Chinatown; went to law school; carved out an illustrious career representing community organizations in Chinatown; and then, and only then, decided to start a bank because he felt it was the right thing to do. In his own words, the non-Chinese banks in the area were willing to take his countrymen’s deposits—but never loan out a cent. </p>  <p>            The bank that Thomas Sung built, Abacus Federal Savings Bank, was dedicated to the mission of putting the American dream within reach of the Chinese immigrants that settled in New York. To accomplish this, it had to take a tailored approach: service in Cantonese as well as English, and underwriting practices that acknowledged unique, local economic realities, such as “renumerations” that blurred the line between gift and loan, and businesses that kept sparse records and operated mostly in cash. Perhaps it is a testament to the strength of Thomas’s vision that his three daughters, who grew up in Greenwich, CT, decided to run the bank with him after graduating college rather than pursuing more glamorous careers uptown. </p>  <p>            What is the strangest thing about this picture? Is it the exotic terrain of Chinatown, whose vivid sights and smells James brings to life? Or is it something more fundamental—the idea of banking as not just legitimate, but indeed honorable <i>vocation </i>(calling; life’s work), of a banker as a vital part of the community?</p>  <p>            Both of these concerns come to bear on the second question posed above. The bulk of the documentary focuses on the exhausting legal battle that the Sung family must wage against the New York DA’s office, which accuses them of selling fraudulent mortgages to Fannie Mae. The reason this is ridiculous is because unlike the billions of dollars of actually<i> </i>fraudulent mortgages (not to mention the even greater quantity of derivative products) underwritten and sold to the public by giant financial institutions, the mortgages originated by Abacus were sound; people paid them back. The question, then, is not how, but why: why was Abacus singled out for a crime it did not commit, when the real perpetrators were already tried and set free? </p>  <p>            The undeniable racism of the DA’s decision to use Abacus as a scapegoat is made obvious in a single, gutwrenching scene in which several Chinese employees of the bank are brought into a police station, cuffed to one another, and paraded around the station in front of the press like a modern-day chain gang. The film’s very title downplays this essential fact. Abacus wasn’t indicted because it was small. There are small banks all over America that weren’t targeted. It was singled out because it was different; because its customers were “foreigners,” who spoke a different language, who naturally couldn’t be trusted. Unfortunately, the logic behind the DA’s choice to bully the Abacus Federal Savings Bank is plain and simple: the system, overcome by the nausea of its own moral toxin, resorted to purging its guilty conscience by projecting its contradictions onto an entity it perceived as alien to itself, and betting that the latter wouldn’t have the wherewithal to fight back. Of course, the particular ethnic context of this profiling is made all the more salient by recent trends in US-China relations: economic and military competition between a sitting and a rising superpower, false accusations of espionage levied against Chinese American scientists, the age-old idea of a “Yellow Peril.” Yet how supremely and transparently ironic that the villainous role the DA attempted to wedge Abacus into suits no one better than the deeply entrenched banks it has already pardoned. Ultimately, what the prosecution’s case demonstrates best of all is the acuteness of its own moral crisis.</p>  <p>            When all is said and done, credit emerges as a fitting lens through which to consider relations between old Americans and new. America is a nation of immigrants, and she has many languages. But because of our financial system, money is the universal language that binds our communities together. If you reject my bond on the basis of ethnicity, then you refute my right to co-exist with you. The odious implication that “the Chinese mortgages are poisonous” puts a stain on the entire community, casts it as a tumor to the body politic. In the end, it was one of Thomas’s friends who said it best: “It’s not about Abacus being clear, it’s about exonerating our entire community.” </p>  <p>            Unlike George Bailey, Thomas Sung didn’t have a guardian angel to save him. What he had instead were his loving wife and three daughters, whose care and affection make for some of the most moving scenes in the entire film. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the Sung’s is how they elevated themselves through their protracted battle to become ideal citizens. They refused to kowtow; they spoke truth to power—in eloquent, American English, and in doing so, spoke on behalf of first generation immigrants everywhere.  </p>  <p>            <i><em>Abacus</em> </i>is a film that shows the best and the worst of modern America. For that reason, it will surely give any viewer much to think about. </p>",

		"body" : "<p>It was only fitting that Michelle Kuo gave her Cambridge reading at the Cambridge Public Library. College ’03 and Law School ’09, and now a professor at the American University of Paris, Kuo spent two years after college in Helena, Arkansas with Teach for America. Her memoir, <i>Reading With Patrick</i>, documents and reflects on her time working with Patrick Browning, a quiet and introspective student in her classroom whom she returned to Arkansas to see upon learning he had been placed in jail for killing another man. While awaiting Patrick’s trial, in which the unintentional death was ultimately charged as manslaughter, Patrick and Kuo read and wrote together every day.<br></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I sat down with Michelle to talk about the complex process of writing and discussing the memoir, the questions we ask ourselves as progressives and young people, and, of course, books. Kuo almost reflexively followed every answer, as she had at the reading, with “Does that makes sense?” or “Does that help?”—an incorrigible teacher.</p>      <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>EZ: </strong>How have you thought about writing since college until now?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>MK:</strong> I think when I was in college I thought of myself as an activist. I worked many nights at the homeless shelter and had a binary idea of what it meant to live meaningfully. Everything else was being selfish. And I put creative pursuits in the selfish category. This is because I also met some creative people who were really pretentious and didn’t seem to care about the world, and I was just like, “Who are you? There’s like, people starving out there.” But I’m sure I was pretentious with my moral claims, so that’s fine.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I always loved reading, loved literature. Ever since I was a kid, books were my refuge. And having Taiwanese parents who wanted me to study math, they abstractly understood books were good, but they didn’t know what to recommend. Books were the one place where I felt like I could have control over my education. I read so much. Throughout my 20s, I was always pursuing social justice professions. I did legal aid for Mexican immigrants and I taught in Arkansas. But there was a way in which I was really suppressing my desire to write. I think if you are a writer by constitution, even if you’re not writing you find yourself compulsively forming sentences in your head, trying to make sense of things that happen that confuse you or break your heart or that collapse your sense of yourself. And that’s what happened in the story that I wrote about Patrick, the student that I had in Arkansas who was so quiet and introspective. After I left Arkansas, I found out he had gotten in a fight and killed someone. It wasn’t just about writing, but about getting down the story. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I think you’re always trying to live meaningfully, but you’re also trying to permit yourself to be selfish, and life is a constant negotiation between those two impulses. Even now, with Patrick, I try to stay in touch and be present, but I also have to live my own life. It’s hard to do both well.</p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong></strong></p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong></strong></p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>EZ:</strong> How is Patrick doing? (As much as you and he would be comfortable discussing.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>MK:</strong> Well, the end of the book is basically where he is now. Not a great place—he’s still looking for a job. The hard thing about looking for a job that isn’t totally intuitive for people who haven’t been jobless is that not only is rural Arkansas a hard place to find a job—and if you have a felony conviction it’s incredibly hard—but if you keep on getting turned away you do lose motivation. It’s just a fact. You get ashamed of asking. So then part of the cycle is that you have a little self-loathing because part of you knows you’ve given up. It’s all very complex and in some ways impenetrable, the degree of “personal fault” that conservatives like to point to, and the actual, incredibly deep structural limitations.</p>      <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>EZ: </strong>What was hard about writing <i>Reading With Patrick? </i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><br></i></p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong></strong></p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>MK:</strong> The hardest thing for me was when I was writing these scenes where Patrick’s writing was improving, where he was becoming mesmerized by certain lines of poetry—in real life I knew he was already out of prison and struggling to find a job. That disconnect was really painful because you’re recording this indisputable progress that this person made, this increased confidence he has in himself, this stunning quality of his own reading and writing—but in real life, three years later, in some ways he’s regressed again. And the purpose of writing also becomes more clear: you’re trying to capture this moment that otherwise might be lost, but it also seems your writing doesn’t change where he is now. It’s a constant struggle with writing: you just want to put down the pen and go out into the world and do something. And that’s a constant negotiation, too, of being of the world, and yet also giving yourself the kindness to make sense of the world separately. Closing the door, opening the door; it’s always about how often you’re closing, how often you’re opening. </p>      <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>EZ: </strong>When you published your <strong><a href=\"A%20Conversation%20with%20Michelle%20Kuo%20%20It%20was%20only%20fitting%20that%20Michelle%20Kuo%20gave%20her%20Cambridge%20reading%20at%20the%20Cambridge%20Public%20Library.%20College%20’03%20and%20Law%20School%20’09,%20and%20now%20a%20professor%20at%20the%20American%20University%20of%20Paris,%20Kuo%20spent%20two%20years%20after\">first piece of writing about Patrick</a></strong> in the <i>New York Times</i> Magazine, having Patrick read it made you realize the piece was for you, not him, that in some way you had taken his story for your own means. How did you reconsider or navigate this while writing your memoir? How did you / have you dialogued with Patrick during the process?<strong></strong></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>MK:</strong> This question is really important and weighs on me. Patrick has been extremely generous about letting me share his story; he told me that he believes in God and that this is testimony. But that was three years ago when he had a job. Now I think he is also anxious, and his feelings about the book have changed according to how he’s feeling about his life. Which makes perfect sense: whenever we feel good about where we are in life, we care less about people knowing things in our past; and when we feel bad about where we are in life, we don’t like being exposed. So he has a mixture of emotions depending on his situation, and I also try to share with him my own feelings about the book, stressing to him that people will have a warm and humane picture of him. And I have shared with him the book. He’s read some parts—he didn’t read the plea bargain and criminal justice parts, because it’s traumatic to remember. But he’s read the parts about his mother, and I read aloud sections to him. I think the parts about his mother mean the most to him, because she’s passed away and not around anymore. What really got him was the part where she says it’s not like him to hurt a person, that’s not who he is, made him cry. He said he needed to hear that again. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I’ve also told him that the story is not just about him, but about me, about how I grew up differently from him, and the kinds of things I experienced as being Asian in western Michigan, and how my parents had such love for me and where they come from, Taiwan. He really loved hearing that, because he’s a curious person and, more generally, kids in the Delta are cut off from the world and are thirsty to hear about other ways that people live and come up.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I’m glad that this question was asked, even though it’s a very painful question for me. I have tried to talk to him about this process in an open, generous and ethical way. Money is always uncomfortable, and I have shared the advance with him as well as donated to the Boys & Girls Club in Arkansas and created a college fund for his daughter. </p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong></strong></p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong></strong></p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>EZ: </strong>The charge you were answering in going to the Delta was, in many ways, a James Baldwin quote you include in the memoir: “He may stand with you through thin, but not thick,” Baldwin wrote, at the time of white liberals; they have “all the proper attitudes—but they have no real convictions. And when the chips are down and you expect them to deliver on what you thought they felt, they somehow are not there.” </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is easy and gratifying for affluent people with progressive ideals to read and say and think the right things, but rarer to see them out in action when and where it is needed. How do you feel about the way you answered Baldwin's charge—and how have you continued to think about it in terms of your decisions, especially in an era where the accusations of liberal hypocrisy have become ever more pointed? </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>MK:</strong> That Baldwin quote about hypocrisy is constantly on my mind. He writes that liberals read all the right things and have all the proper attitudes, but when the chips are down, they somehow are not there. I took that phrase literally: the Delta is a place where few liberals go today. I wanted to place myself in daily relationships with people from different backgrounds, and attempt meaningful and mutual connections. And I wanted to acknowledge when I failed, understanding that a self should be built out of a person’s relationships and actions.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It’s a very polarized political climate now, and each person tries to outdo the other by being more moral, more leftist, more uncompromising. I feel a bit sick at escalating nature of moral grandstanding, and take a lot of inspiration from the language of leftist Christian and Jewish traditions, which are more gentle and open in their language. Often they are humble about the worlds that they don’t know; are quick to suspect themselves of arrogance; and don’t take any thrill in condemning others. They tend to embrace talking about their own human limitations, and I think that also opens up others.  We got a little bit of that humility from progressives the day after the election—the mea culpa, self-searching—but it disappeared because, well, Trump is crazy and angering, and we are creatures of habit, and also, we have to fight. But we must not forget the intimate long game, which demands placing our own senses of self at risk, in relationships and places where people are of different backgrounds. (And policy-wise, building institutions in rural areas that need help.) </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even the common mistake of thinking “rural” means “white”—one out of five rural people are people of color, and they are the poorest in the country—suggests how cut off urban progressives are from rural areas.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I also think that “service” is a concept that is not ironic or questioned in religious communities, and, relatedly, that is central to traditions in African American and Latino communities. I remember in college how some of the secular activists I hung out with in college tended to have a distaste for “service”—tutoring, teaching, mentoring—and acted as if service was “feel good” and what they did, organizing, was gritty and more important. I did both, and I don’t see why the two have to be mutually exclusive. In fact, they shouldn’t be. We know that some of the most prominent activists in Black Lives Matter, for instance, came to the movement through experiences as teachers. And they were able to organize because vulnerable communities know teachers intimately, as people who show up every day to work with and learn from them.  </p>      <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>EZ:</strong> <i>Reading With Patrick’s </i>subtitle is “A Teacher, A Student, and a Life-Changing Friendship.” When I saw the word “life-changing” I think I had a gut reaction of worry that it would make people read it as a certain kind of feel-good narrative. How would you hope for people to critically engage with the memoir as they read it? To talk to it?</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>MK:</strong> One of the hardest questions about the book is what really happened. Things seem to be happening really fast when we’re reading together, right. And it’s really different from our common idea of education, which is: You gain skills; you’re able to uplift yourself from one class to the next. When Patrick is able to see himself in another character, or alternatively, when he reads Frederick Douglass and doesn’t see himself in Douglass—there are these really intangible moments happening that are hard to place in terms of, “he was able to use his literacy to fill out a job application.” Rather, there’s an inner life changing in a way you can’t pin down. I hope a liberal with really strong ideas of how social change should happen is thinking about these smaller, seemingly tiny moments where a person has this flicker of warmth toward himself. That those are the moments when people grow—these individual, silent interactions.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That’s also the most difficult thing about the book: did this change his life? And that’s the pain of the book; I think his literacy regresses again at the end. He just hits the wall, has bad luck as well as a felony conviction and living in Arkansas. One thing I didn’t put in the book because it happens later on: there’s just so much child support debt that piles up while you’re in prison and that makes it impossible to open up a bank account, so there’s a criminalization of poverty that’s happening where you’re punished for being poor. And all of those things are counter to our desires, right, for a happy ending? I think the reader will be challenged by the lack of a happy ending. In some ways, that’s how it kind of defies any savior genre. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It’s interesting you mentioned that subtitle. The publicist proposed that, and at first I thought, “but I didn’t change his life.” And then Albert [my husband] said to me, “you didn’t change his life in a way you wanted. But you changed how he experienced himself when he was incarcerated, and that matters. That has a tangible effect.” And the other part of reading that word is, “Did he change my life?” Yes. It’s stupid to think that I would matter, but it’s also stupid to think I don’t matter. He changed my idea of what I think about literacy and how important it is, my idea of how you create actively engaged, human people. Through reading and writing is one way. He changed the way I think about the “violent young offender”—not as somebody innately dangerous but a person who is a product of debilitating poverty. I guess we know that, but now I know that’s the message that you really have to double down on if you’re a progressive. Progressives tend to avoid it when they talk about mass incarceration, focusing on nonviolent drug offenses, but violent offenders make up 50 percent of our state prison population. Conservatives love the opportunity to talk about it. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But I also winced a little at the word [“life-changing”], and then I tried to understand my wincing. It’s because our generation has been raised to be really cynical of earnest stories. There’s a certain ironic tone that writers take, and that’s probably why I was alienated from writers in college. It’s like, “you haven’t earned the right to be cynical.” You haven’t. A lot of people haven’t.  You have to earn the right to be cynical, and that comes from showing up to places that need people or yourself growing up in circumstances that are deeply challenging. I haven’t earned the right to be cynical either, so I’m like, “Fine! I’ll just keep being earnest and people will laugh at me.”</p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong></strong></p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong></strong></p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>EZ: </strong>How has your teaching in the Delta continued to influence your teaching at the university level?<strong></strong></p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>MK:</strong> It’s shaped my teaching in profound ways. A lot of college pedagogy is decades behind high school pedagogy, and yet professors tend to snub their noses at new, research-tested techniques. There’s this idea that when a kid becomes 18, she magically becomes an adult and if she can’t do it the professor’s way, she just can’t hack it. I just don’t agree with that kind of philosophy. It basically caters to the students who have a particular kind of intelligence and discipline. But most students, whether motivated or not, do crave <i>something </i>from education, and a teacher needs to try a variety of techniques to meet them where they’re at. Teaching in the Delta taught me that if a classroom feels like a community, that can be very motivating. I also think teaching in the Delta helped me understand that a student is above all a person, with needs and desires and a life outside the classroom. </p>      <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>EZ:</strong> There’s this (maybe falsely strict) line between public and private sectors that you’ve zigzagged across: Harvard College, then Teach for America, then Harvard Law School, then legal aid and back to the Delta, now at American University in Paris. I think that line is a thing a lot of students at Harvard struggle with, like: do I have to doublethink myself into doing both, or being one kind of person and feeling like I’m on the wrong side of the line? How has it been as you move between those worlds? What questions have you asked yourself? What’s brought you to some kind of equilibrium?</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>MK:</strong> (Before I answer that, make sure you ask me about Teach for America, just because I feel like there’s such a contingent of people who are very skeptical of Teach for America.) </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yeah, I think there’s so much anxiety in Harvard students to want to be really successful. And I try to—I wish, I hope, that I can acquire a kind of spiritual happiness that disavows any of those worldly desires. I don’t think I’ve achieved that; I think few people have who have gone through Harvard have. I was really indecisive about a lot of things, and I think that’s partly from being Asian American, having parents whose way of communication is to make you doubt yourself. One thing I’ve noticed about Asian American writers is how vulnerable they tend to be, and I wonder whether they’ve internalized their parents’ voices, like: “Who are you to think you can do this? How could you do this? How could you do this to <i>me</i>?”… that’s partially where the indecisiveness comes from. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At Harvard, when I found out I couldn’t hack it in Math 21a I didn’t want to do it anymore. That’s really screwed up. That’s not how most of the world works, where hobbies are hobbies and you can do things even though you’re at the bottom of whatever ranking would exist. I started recently taking a singing class last year. I’ve never been a singer, I’ve always been like “I’m a horrible singer!” And I thought, I’m just going to do it. And it is so joyful to do something without expecting to perform. It’s not about being good at it, it’s just the pure joy of being able to hit the right note… it’s taken me a long time to get to that point.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In terms of my career choices…because of my tendency to think in moral absolutes, I always chose the profession that paid the least. That was sort of my way of retaining my moral badge, but that’s kind of screwed up, too! “I don’t know how to choose, so I’ll just choose the thing that definitely won’t bring me any monetary benefit.” I’m being a bit self-deprecating, I’m not that stupid about choosing my jobs. I’ve chosen the work that gets me closest to people. When you’re doing legal aid, you can help somebody who’s being evicted. You can help a dishwasher who hasn’t been paid because his employer knows he’s undocumented and won’t speak up. It just happens that that work is the least paid of any legal profession. I think some Asian Americans are slower in figuring out what they want because they’ve internalized their parents’ voices so deeply that they’re confused. Even now, I’m still sad I’m not a doctor, and I don’t know whether that’s because I actually realized that doctors can help people and it’s a portable skill, or that it’s just like my mom speaking to me when I was five years old. But… you have to be patient with yourself to figure out what you like.</p>      <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>EZ:</strong> And you wanted to say something about Teach for America (TFA)?</p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong></strong></p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>MK:</strong> So there’s a range of critiques of Teach for America, and I think it’s good that they raise consciousness of corporate collaboration and the rights of workers, especially in urban contexts. I’m a workers’ rights lawyer so I’m really sympathetic. But I wish many would be more open to the fact that their critiques generally don’t apply to rural areas—especially after Trump was elected, we’re all thinking about rural areas and how the divide between urban and rural worlds is growing. Teachers from Teach for America go to these rural regions; it’s the only national institution besides AmeriCorps that sends graduates to these areas and facilitates movements between urban and local areas. We’re talking about Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Southern Louisiana, South Dakota, North Carolina, Appalachia, areas with shortages—and we need institutions that create more intimacy between these areas where, increasingly, the rural kids who graduate from high school leave and don’t come back. There is devastating out-population. If you want to criticize Teach for America, do it locally. Go to a rural area and figure out whether Teach for America teachers are collaborating with civic and political organizations. Figure out how many of them stay and what they do when they stay. Figure out if there’s any particular local history projects or local arts that get stressed by those teachers. That would be more interesting and based in locally grounded research. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The other thing that I find revealing is the idea TFA teachers as white elitists, which is not true anymore. Prominent Black Lives Matter leaders came out of Teach for America. 50% of TFA-ers are people of color. Some of the most inspiring people I know are African American teachers from Teach for America who are not from Mississippi and Arkansas but traveled there to teach, and 15 years later, are still there. They have stories to tell and are part of a DuBoisian tradition of teaching in rural black communities. If you say TFA is white and elitist, you’re part of the problem. You’re making invisible these leaders who are teaching in communities and leading political movements.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The last thing, which I think is an important historical point: let’s think about the assumption that an outsider is intrinsically bad. Recall that we valorize outsiders, college students from all over the country, who traveled to the South in the 1960s to desegregate public areas, register voters, and start schools. It was the Southern segregationists who labeled these students as “outside agitators” in order to delegitimize them. The term “outsider” is always changing in terms of its valence. Let’s be careful of becoming so paralyzed by our consciousness of being perceived as outsiders that we don’t learn anymore, don’t go anywhere at all. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>EZ:</strong> What do you wish people asked you?</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>MK:</strong> Being asked about the Asian American part is really important to me, because I feel like it explains so much of the hyper-uncertainty of the book, which I think can be really off-putting for readers who don’t know how much uncertainty exists in our lives because of our parents. Not all Asian Americans, but most. Often we feel a constant desire to want them to feel like they can be proud and also to place ourselves in America in some way that feels meaningful. And these desires are often at odds because part of what our parents want is for us to blend in so much that we’re totally anonymous. That’s why my parents wanted me to go into science and be a doctor, because they’re like, “It’s safer there. There are more Asians there. It’s not subjective in terms of how your work is evaluated. Once you pass the test, they can’t change your grade.” This thinking is such a product of the competitive education system in Taiwan that’s modernizing, similar to China, Korea, and Japan. I was trying to grapple with the uncertainty and risk aversion that you develop both at an elite institution, and also from parents who are immigrants.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong></strong></p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>EZ:</strong> Do you have any writing projects on the horizon?</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>MK:</strong> I’m really interested in a [W.G. Sebald]-esque style, and I love Rachel Cusk, but maybe I’ll experiment. But I don’t know, I’m so drained from writing this book. I feel that it’s all about taking it really slowly. I’m happy that I didn’t come out too early. My writing’s gotten better, it’s changed. Even though I wish I had finished this earlier, like two years ago, if you gave it to me now I would know where to revise. Time is such a healer. Time is your best friend—and at the same time it’s best to get one thing done so you can get to the next thing.</p>      <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>EZ:</strong> What are things you like to do or read that make you want to write?</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>MK:</strong> Rachel Cusk makes me want to write; she’s so smart.

And then there’s this moment that comes when you realize you’ve just been obeying a ritual without remembering the origin of that ritual, which is presence, contrition, love for people and the world and its creatures. And this happens to me in cycles—but I never predict the cycles, which is good—where I’ll just stop obeying these rituals of writing and going out, taking walks, calling old friends. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Reading poetry always helps a lot—memorizing poetry, not just reading it, and feeling the sounds. That it’s meant to be unmediated, the sounds of the words are meant to be unmediated, just as the voice is unmediated, which is why I love singing more. Hearing the sounds of animals is unmediated. I don’t know if that helps, but it’s more like this break where you’re totally present with the spiritual connectedness of things. And I wish I had more things to bring me that. Every year, my new year’s resolution is to become better a meditating and being more spiritually present. Maybe this will be my year.</p>      <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>EZ:</strong> How is it being on book tour right now?</p>    <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>MK:</strong> The thing I’ve tried to figure out this year is, as with being a person, being a writer is learning to forgive yourself and saying, “There will be more sentences that you write.” The book is a lot about my own failures and having that exposed is very hard for me. I feel like I can be open with people in conversations, but having it out in print is really scary. But you know, the thing that emboldens me is knowing that Asian Americans and African Americans have a real divide, real disconnect. I wanted to make that bridge. And I wanted to place the children of immigrants in a rural place that is majority black. </p>",

		"body" : "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Poking fun at Pitchfork Media –– indie tastemaker slash never-ending bastion of cultural snobbery and<i> Portlandia </i>material –– is an act that is facile to the point of being self-defeating. This is the website, after all, that pioneered the decimal-digit review score and worked itself into logical convulsions deciding whether Andrew W.K. was <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16836-i-get-wet/\">ironically dumb or just dumb</a>, and whether there was any discernible difference between the two positions in the first place. To call Pitchfork hilariously overwrought might be the most redundant statement in the universe. To call it pretentious would be lazy. Pitchfork is certainly both of those things, but more than that it has become a cultural artifact, <i>Rolling Stone </i>for the brunch-goer. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tWhen Pitchfork launched in 1995, however, it was essentially a local hub for Minneapolis area bands and college radio station diehards. Over the next decade and a half, however, the magazine became both purveyor and documentarian-in-chief of hipster culture, churning out a number of hugely influential reviews (remember when Pitchfork singlehandedly launched the careers of Arcade Fire, The Dismemberment Plan, Interpol and Bon Iver (and thus, unintentionally, Post Malone)?) and a number of unspeakably revolting ones (remember when Ryan Schreiber thought it would be cool to write an entire review of Coltrane in ebonics?). </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tFor better or worse, Pitchfork was a champion of something resembling a cultural movement. But let’s face it, hipsterdom was bound to die off. It had, at its core, numerous contradictions: it was a group movement built around rejecting groupthink, an anti-corporate aesthetic you could buy <a href=\"http://www.americanapparel.com/en/\"><u>(good fucking riddance, Dov Charney)</u></a>, a pseudo-rebellion that turned not having an opinion on Animal Collective into an act of oppression. It was a culture that had a number of very <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/121437/why-indie-music-so-unbearably-white\"><u>problematic issues</u></a> regarding race. It was the pre-distressed denim of revolutions. Its only ideological principle was a supposed anti-corporate aversion to “selling out” that was completely debased when Conde Nast gobbled up Pitchfork in 2015 as part of its continual quest to purchase the concept of culture. “Pitchfork to join the company’s esteemed editorial brands,” the headline went. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tOf course, I still read - past and present tense - Pitchfork. Many people did, even as it gradually became clear we weren’t really in on the joke so much as we were the butt of it. Here’s the thing, though: Pitchfork, for the better part of the last two years, has been experiencing one of the most public and interesting identity crises in online media history. All good things come to an end, and in 2015 hipster culture was pronounced officially dead in a slew of unreadably pretentious thinkpieces (my personal favorite is <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/exqkke/hw-here-lies-the-hipster-999\"><u>this one</u></a> from <i>Vice</i>, which opens with a line from Rimbaud’s <i>A Season in Hell</i>). </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tSo Pitchfork was now a publication that had lost its cultural motor. Not only that, 2016’s election marked the end of the Obama years, a halcyon backdrop that had allowed hipsterdom to thrive unchecked. Not only is hipsterdom dead in the Trump era, many of its defining features –– narcissism, self-absorption, complacency, political quietism –– represent something dangerously irresponsible and out of touch. In a sadly emblematic development, onetime hipster godfather Gavin McInnes now cozies up to white supremacists and revels in essentially being Rush Limbaugh with better clothes and more extreme beliefs. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tThe 2017 installment of Pitchfork’s annual music festival was thus a momentous affair. It was, in effect, a massive forum on the future of Pitchfork - and its readership - in a post-hipster America. That might not seem like much on the surface, and it probably (definitely) isn’t, but for someone who has been reading (and sharing/hating/laughing at/memorizing) Pitchfork reviews for the better part of six years this was something close to Woodstock. And, in the interest of time, I’ll lead with the fact that it was pretty damn good. Headline: Pitchfork lives to host another festival without surrendering to its own obsolescence.  </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tNot that anyone would have doubted this based on the lineup, which leaked on Reddit prior to the festivities. It was an interesting mix of alternative music legends (Madlib, American Football, The Feelies, PJ Harvey), the daring new guard of the indie sound Pitchfork helped solidify in the mid-2000s (Mitski, Vagabon, Angel Olsen, Jeff Rosenstock) and some of the most exciting innovators in popular music today (Danny Brown, Arca, Colin Stetson, Solange). And Parliament Funkadelic, just for good measure. Also the guys who did the Stranger Things theme, because why not?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tOf course, music festivals are nothing if not their headliners, and the three-act progression of LCD Soundsystem, A Tribe Called Quest and Solange was –– intentionally or not –– a thoughtful examination of the magazine’s past, present and future. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tDay one was a funeral, the official death of hipster culture as we know it brought to you by the guys who made it happen in the first place. LCD Soundsystem –– since it burst onto blogs everywhere in 2002 with the hilariously enduring “Losing My Edge” –– had always thrived by branding themselves as the moral core of hipster culture. At their peak, James Murphy was the poster boy of hyper self-aware hipsters who mercilessly skewered the scene (“I heard you have a compilation of every good song ever done by anybody” is the deadpan thesis statement of “Losing My Edge”) while also being hopelessly, helplessly submerged in it. Case in point: did you know that James Murphy has a wine bar in Brooklyn called “the four horsemen” (the all-lowercase is his idea) where you can purchase bread for six dollars? </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tAs is customary of LCD Soundsystem sets, the performance was awe-inspiring. Pat Mahoney played drums like a man pursued at gun point, Nancy Whang’s keyboard solos made synth pop almost seem like a good idea again, and James Murphy proved once more that he has the reluctant rock-star gimmick down to a science. Tank-top clad concertgoers put down their PBRs and vape pens to group hug during “New York I Love You But You’re Bringing Me Down,” and “All My Friends” was as triumphant as ever. But Pitchfork was wise to put the band up first - there was, at the root of it, a kind of ennui. Hadn’t we seen this before, when James Murphy screamed himself hoarse at Madison Square Garden in 2011, reminding us all that New York was indeed the one pool where he’d happily drown before ending the band and making a <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/LCD-Soundsystem-The-Long-Goodbye-LCD-Soundsystem-Live-At-Madison-Square-Garden/master/692177\"><u>$200 box set </u></a>out of it? Isn’t making fun of hipsters even more lame than hipsters at this point? LCD was a band that had defined themselves against an endlessly mockable cultural moment that suddenly found themselves stripped of that context (in a fitting move, the once ever-present “Losing My Edge” was left off the setlist). James Murphy looked triumphant and drunk as the stage lights turned out, but he also looked old. Don’t ask me how I feel about their new album yet. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tIf LCD finally torpedoed off all remnants of hipster culture on Friday night, A Tribe Called Quest proved the next day why the funeral was a necessary one. This was Tribe’s first public show since the death of founding member Phife Dawg, and the show was a triumphant, poignant sendoff to his legacy. It was also, in my experience at least, the undisputed pinnacle of Pitchfork Music Festival 2017 (I didn’t get to see Solange). Tribe left a mic empty the entire night for Phife, playing pre-recorded versions of his verses when his parts came up. It was an initially jarring set-up that was as ingenious as it was powerful. For me, nothing at the festival really compared to the emotions of seeing the call-and-response section of “Check the Rhime” live, Q-Tip firing back at Phife’s disembodied cue lines. Above all, however, Tribe’s show was an unfiltered, hyper-urgent call to action. After they played the giddying “Award Tour” and “Can I Kick It?” multiple times –– Ali Muhammad spinning the record back after each repetition –– the group finished with “We the People…..” from their most recent record, <i>We Got it From Here…Thank You 4 Your Service, </i>released shortly after Trump’s election<i>.</i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tThe world-weary ellipsis after “We the People” is in many ways emblematic of the album as a whole. That record had been a bittersweet affair, a the sound of a group of poets forcibly summoned out of retirement by developments beyond their control. Sure, comebacks are sweet, but in this case the circumstances that made Tribe so immediate and necessary again were far from pleasant. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tBy the time Ali Muhammad cued the thundering bass intro for “We the People……” a third time, however, any hint of uncertainty was gone. This was music with a purpose, music that needed to be heard. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\t“We the people!” Q-Tip led the audience after the song ended. “We all equal! </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Resist!” </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* * * </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tPitchfork was an interesting venue for Tribe’s reunion, but in some ways it was a perfect follow up to LCD Soundsystem. Q-Tip’s call-and-response was a reminder of why hipsterdom was no longer viable in the age of Trump. The hipster mentality –– isolating individuality as an end in and of itself, a life lived under the threatening bogeyman of “the mainstream” –– was an outmoded form of existing in an age that requires social justice and unflinching calls for action. It was no coincidence that the hipster folk hero of old had been Justin Vernon, he who holed up in a cabin alone for months and recorded an indie-folk classic (still a fantastic record, fight me). Vernon, however, represented an idealized distillation of the American hipster’s obsession with retreating from a society that they view as fundamentally unalterable. For the assembled audience, myself very much included, ATCQ’s performance was about revealing the mix of isolationist complacency and defeatism that had subtly infiltrated hipster culture. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tIt’s been less than a week since A Tribe Called Quest decided to break up for good in honor of Phife Dawg. It was an inspiring, brave run of shows that I was lucky to have been some part of, albeit from an awful corner spot that meant I almost strained my left shoulder trying to catch a glimpse of Q-Tip’s face. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tOf course, Pitchfork 2017 did not end on Tribe. The last act –– which, full disclosure, I did not get to see –– was Solange. If LCD Soundsystem marked the end of Pitchfork’s cultural dominion and A Tribe Called Quest highlighted the necessity for a radical rethinking of its mission, Solange’s show was Pitchfork’s case for its continued existence. A publication like Pitchfork, at the end of the day, still has cultural value if it can bring a wider audience to daring, innovative musicians and artists like Solange, whose 2016 release <i>A Seat at the Table </i>blended everything from soul to ambient music into an undeniable statement of personal and political discovery. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tOf course, this necessitates a complete re-imagination of Pitchfork’s role. It can no longer be the imposing tastemaker constantly searching for the purest, narrowest form of what true indie music and indie culture entails. Instead, 2017 requires Pitchfork to be less of a cultural monolith and more of a platform and megaphone that serves a secondary role to the individualism and artistry of daring musicians. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tAs a long-suffering reader, that would be my hope at least. </p>",

NPR’s been hosting the concerts since 2008 (there had been 550, viewed a collective 80 million times <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/11/21/13550754/npr-tiny-desk-concert\"><u>as of November 2016</u></a>), and the yearly contest is going on its fourth cycle now. But as much of an NPR fan-girl as I am Tank’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKzobTCIRDw\"><u>video</u></a> is the first I remember watching the whole way through. Because, and maybe there’s no other way to put it, Tank, and The Bangas, are <i>artists</i> in a spectacularly new way.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This past Thursday the group came up (they’re from and based in New Orleans) with Sweet Crude to play a gig at The Sinclair. Sweet Crude opened, starting exactly on time (and maybe I’m not going to enough Sinclair gigs but that has never happened to me, not <i>once</i>, not even within 15 minutes of the posted time) and right away had the half-full crowd completely rapt. Alexis Marceaux, in particular, one half of the front of the band (completed by Sam Craft) was such a presence that it was easy to forget there were other things going on. Her emphasis on <i>performing</i>, rather than just playing, retrospectively was a great set-up for a similar vibe from Tank, though I’d be remiss not to include that the entire band (NB comment if you agree the keyboardist looks like a bassist) were certainly musicians of an impressive caliber, with complete control of rhythm and mood. They made switching tempos look easy, and the rough choreography read as authentic good vibes between whoever took part. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/IMG_0231.JPG\" width=\"583\" height=\"485\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 583px; height: 485px; display: block; margin: auto;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\" rel=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I would confirm the <a href=\"http://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/entertainment_life/music/article_e1283b57-916e-5a52-8aa7-ee477b07cfb7.html\"><u>other Advocate’s</u></a> 2014 impression that “Sweet Crude’s sonic scaffolding is built of vocals and drums,” which was new and exciting to hear but lacked some diversity. The moments of Louisianan French too, were cool and unexpected, but whether or not they’re native speakers most of it was too garbled to understand (not so for the English bits.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When Tank and The Bangas came on we were <i>ready</i>, and the trickle that’d filled gaps between couples and friends in the Sinclair’s open lobby meant you could literally feel the excitement with every neighbor that bumped you turning to grin at their friends. The opening (they did <i>Intro</i> from Think Tank and <i>Crazy</i>) was rough after the nuance of Sweet Crude’s performance, and it was hard to hear melody or anything other than drums and a general wall of sound, but I’d put that onto poor sound balancing from tech rather than a fault of the performers specifically. Even through the “wall of sound” vibe though, performers seemed to be taking it as a challenge to play or sing louder and more passionately, which was exciting even if it didn’t help the audibility issue. By <i>Quick</i> though, the fourth song of the set (and the same featured by Tiny Desk) everyone (including the sound guys) found their groove. You’ve probably heard the Tiny Desk version (dude click the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKzobTCIRDw\"><u>link</u></a>, promise it’s worth it) but in person <i>Quick</i> sounds like a spoken word poem over the kind of jam that, once you’ve heard it, you send to that friend whose taste in music is both unimpeachable and untouchable to prove you can touch it. When I called Tank an “artist” earlier it was because no other label, since <i>every</i> other label, seems to fit. She’s a singer, but she’s also a rapper (with moments that couldn’t recall Nicki Minaj more clearly if they were sisters), a spoken word poet, a revolutionary, and a fine, fine musician. And their music is a completely different experience live than it is on the record. It’s good music if you’re listening on the Subway, or in your room. But live, you get the presence of (primarily) Tank and a few other members (Anjelika “Jelly” Joseph deserves a solo career <i>stat</i>) absolutely loving what they do and making sure you love it too.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The crowd (I’m including myself in this) was alternately rapt for quiet moments (like a sick keyboard interlude from Joe Johnson) and bouncing with energy, but never disengaged. Without a doubt I’d see them again (I’d see Sweet Crude too, for that matter) and if I ran a festival TatB would be top of my list. They’re on tour in the states until October 28th (Europe after that) and if you’re into poetry, funk, soul, strong vibes, or are open to having your mind changed on any of the above – quick, get a ticket.<br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/image.png\" width=\"566\" height=\"377\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 566px; height: 377px; display: block; margin: auto;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\" rel=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p>",

The day was cloudy but the author wore a thin grey sweater and a smile. She’d arrived a few minutes past the hour, which most students would probably call early, but Messud began by apologizing: she’d bumped into a former student in the lobby of the English department and had to say hello, probably with a hug, the same way she’d greeted me. We sat and ordered coffee. Next door, a baptism was happening at St. Paul’s. A fire truck screamed past, and I asked about last week’s reading at the Harvard bookstore. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I suppose one way it might be expressed,” Messud tapped her cup, “is that I’m writing a cliche of frustrated narrative expectations.” She was referring to the suggestion, or maybe it was a complaint, that <em>The Burning Girl,</em> her newest novel, lacked the kind of sexiness that defined the bestselling <em>The Woman Upstairs</em> or 2006’s <em>The Emperor’s Children</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> “I wrote <em>The Emperor’s Children</em>  sixteen years ago. This isn’t that novel.”</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What <em>Girl </em>is, she says, is a fairytale for grown-ups. Messud establishes the note of desperate parable right upfront in her epigraph, with an Elizabeth Bishop poem which reads: “Love’s the boy stood on the burning deck/ Trying to recite “The boy stood on the burning deck.” The story, Messud says, is purposefully archetypical. Two girls go into a dark wood; it doesn’t spoil things for you to know that only one of them returns. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This kind of simplicity has confused some folks, such as Christopher Lydon, who spoke with the author last Monday at a reading by Harvard Book Store. Before a packed audience at the Brattle Theatre, the journalist worried through his question:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“How,” he asked, “Are we meant to interpret that conclusion?” He was referring to the undefined relationship between Julia and Cassie, the two young protagonists at the heart of Messud’s novel.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Well.” The author sounded the way she did in workshop when someone asked a question that’d been answered only a moment before. “Do we ever really know?”</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the cafe, I asked about these twin desires: for a sexy novel, for a need to “know how it ends.”</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I’ve said it before,” Messud said, tapping the salt shaker. “Sometimes people want something else of the work. And that’s OK. I’m just not here to give it.”</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">IFJ: <em>Lydon asked about a lack of sexual tension in Julia and Cassie’s friendship. Has this been a frequent Q? </em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I think it’s interesting. He used the word ‘muted.’ And a few reviews, by men, have used the word ‘muted.’ In my last novel, the character begins the work with a rant. And Julia is not Nora. A lot of people hated Nora’s voice; some people loved Nora’s voice. And so those who did love Nora’s voice hate Julia’s voice, because they’re not the same. You know, as a kid I had great passions. I had great, passionate emotions for my friends. Which, in retrospect, seem much like the passions of love later on –– that I was <em>that</em> invested. But that wasn’t something –– back to Elizabeth Bishop –– back to telling my story –– it wasn’t something that I would’ve articulated to anyone. Not even to my diary. My sense of the parameters of expression were different. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">IFJ: <em>So this novel takes our expectation of a gruesome or darker ending and turns it around.</em><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was aware when writing this book of all the risks I felt I was taking. The cliche, the one we all know is, ‘teenage girl goes bad, comes to a bad end.’ And we’ve all seen that story. We’ve seen it on television and read it in books. And it’s a very familiar story. My aim in writing the book was that of those broader questions of telling stories in general, but I also aimed to say: ‘You think you know this story. But you don’t: you never know this story.’ But what does it say about our culture that this is the story on some level that we want and expect?’</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">IF: <em>There’s this one line where Julia says, about these kinds of stories, that they ‘make her the heroine.’ And that rang true, in a weird way. </em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There’s this weird lure! I feel that it’s part of the culture: it has a bad end, but that’s when you get to be the star of the show. There’s always some resignation and some lament in being the storyteller, as opposed to being the one about which the story is told—but, on the other hand, the stories we choose to tell are the sensational: the ones where the character steps outside the parameters of role, of the good girl, and even in telling it—well, there’s that passage in the book where Julia imagines Cassie’s experience of stepping into the neighbor’s car. And thinks, as she does so, ‘it’s so scary, it’s so scary,’ but then she has this moment of self-realization. ‘Maybe it’s just me? Maybe I’m just inventing that fear.’ And actually, it’s weirdly titillating to her. Because, you know, ‘I’m imagining getting into the car, I’m not actually in the car, I’m imagining all that fear’; in some ways, it has the effect of a ghost story, like a thriller. Narrating the story, imagining it, allows you to release fear, in order to contain it. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">IFJ: <em>In your dedications, you credit Louise Gluck’s poem ‘Midsummer,’ which is sort of about that kind of transition –– and yet it’s the Elizabeth Bishop poem, “Casabianca,” which opens the work. Why?</em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Well, Gluck’s is a beautiful work, but it’s a poem about adolescence. It’s an erotic poem, an awakening, and it’s a communal poem. It’s about a particular kind of group dynamic. Those things are important for me in this narrative, but I suppose what’s more important is this specific friendship between Julia and Cassie and the question of narrativity implied.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The “Casabianca,” poem, well –– there used to be a program on British radio, you must even have it now, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnmr\"><u>known as Desert Island tapes</u></a>. And they’d ask you to tell your life in seven pieces of music–– seven items to express who you were ––if you had seven items, what would they be? This poem would be one. Elizabeth Bishop was my formative poet. Before her, I had read poems and loved them, but then I found her, and I thought, this is a poet who articulates something. She had this sense of humor that just spoke to me. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">IFJ: <em>It’s a very satirical poem.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Right! There’s a kind of acidity –– acerbity –– an ascetic quality. It’s the plainness with the humor, which is actually incredibly tough. If you think of that one poem of hers, “The Art of Losing,” –– “is not hard to master/ losing you –– don’t say it –– a disaster.” Now I’m mangling it, but Bishop writes about this string of very simple, very light items, lost –– a ring of keys, your old house, or whatever –– the rhythms and the diction are so very simple and light but the emotional import is very heavy. And you know, Casabianca was a poem that I loved at 17. So that was why.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><br></em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><br></em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>IFJ: </em><em>There’s something so poignant about the boy literally creating the situation - even as he burns.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">CM: Right –– but there’s two boys. Because, ‘love’s the burning boy/ stood on the deck.’ There’s the boy in the original poem, and then there’s the second poem –– a boy on deck, which stands in for the stage, trying to recite the original parlor poem. In the last line where Bishop writes, ‘and love’s the burning boy,’ she means that love is the person trying to tell the story. Who’s the burning girl? Well, there’s Cassie Burnes, literally the burning girl –– but there’s also Julia, the one stammering elocution. And in the way the story is told, in the stammering itself: there’s so much self-conscious artifice. So much fakery. Not even willed, all of it, some of it is unconscious, but it’s the difficulty of telling the story. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don’t know if you’ve had this experience,  but the pain of being a writer –– which is why I don’t write about my life –– why I make stuff up –– is that if you try to write an experience that you’ve had, it covers it in concrete and tamps it down. It’s smaller than it was before. It’s fixed in some way it wasn’t and it’s very hard to get back all the ways it could have been before you set those words down on paper. It’s not that you can’t capture something important about it. Or even the chief of it. But you have to let go of things, too. Of course, if you’re making them up, it’s not quite the same because you’re not aware of what you’ve lost in quite the same way. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But when you’re telling somebody what a childhood best friend is like, you’re never really able to do so: it’s always a containment of the facts, it’s always not quite all of it. It’s always not quite true. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">IFJ: <em>But isn’t there some kind of freedom to that? Do you see yourself in Julia?</em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">CM: For me, this is a book about what it is to be a writer, as much as it is about these two girls and their story. There are moments where Julia says, literally says,<em> I am the Cassandra. </em>You know, it’s the storyteller’s eye –– just a pure knowledge. Whether it’s sitting in front of the film and whispering to your friend, ‘He’s going to die,’ and your friend says, ‘What are you talking about?’ But it’s just a way of seeing the world. A way of viewing the world, narratively. But then of course he does die, because it’s a rare film that doesn’t give you what you expect. And it’s the same in life. They sort of set things up: ‘I’m the storyteller, I’m telling your story; I exist as the vehicle or the filter. But I have something else –– I can see the future and you are doomed.’</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I’ve <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/magazine/whos-afraid-of-claire-messud.html?mcubz=0\"><u>told the story</u></a> of finding my aunt’s diaries to journalists, because it so impressed upon me how much we project our own narratives. It’s as if we have this, and this, and this <em>[here, Messud reaches for the salt and pepper and napkin holder, positions them to make her point]</em>––and I spin a web between these actual points. And I spin a web, which is my actual understanding of what happened, and actually all I have are these points. And somebody could look at them and say, well, actually, your web is not right. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So that was very much in mind as I was writing the last book, and, in a different way, this book as well. Which is about a different kind of life. When you’re a kid, the boundaries don’t exist, the web doesn’t exist: this is what you’ve got, and you’re fine with it! But as you get a bit bigger the boundaries exist. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">IFJ: <em>It’s sort of a necessary process of self-definition. </em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Right! It’s an adolescent process. I’m told that nobody reads Freud anymore, but maybe they read Lacan, and the whole thing of the mirror stage: when a child realizes, ‘that’s me in the mirror, I have an outline, I’m finite, not everything is part of me.’ I must have been either six or five when I asked my mother, if I looked at a painting, might I be able to get inside it. And my mother said, “I don’t know, dear.” And I thought, ok, she’s a liar… Because it seemed sort of unlikely to me, but I still had some faith that those boundaries were porous. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But in adolescence, it’s part of defining oneself to assert these boundaries, to start telling those stories. And part of that is to make up who you are, about how you are, and it’s necessary to define those differences between yourself and others, and what makes you the same or different.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you’re a kid, if you’re healthy, you don’t have a body. You climb trees, you do somersaults –– you just go. Well, not me, I was crap at cartwheels. But for girls, all of a sudden you have a body. And all of a sudden it happens to you. And it does happen to you. At different times, in different ways. It happens: and how we respond to that transition, depends on who we are and where we are when it happens. It puts a lot of stress on intimacies. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">IFJ: <em>How do you balance writing with your teaching? Did teaching a workshop influence this book?</em></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">CM: I’m not usually writing as I’m teaching. I am not writing during term time. I mean I write other things –– book reviews, other things –– but not fiction. I’m sure that, in some way, the voices of young adults like yourself are with me, but I was focused on my daughter’s age group. She’s sixteen now, which makes her two years younger than Julia. At times some people have asked, ‘How did you do your research? What music would your girls listen to?’ Well, all I had do was drive the car! I don’t know if you remember it from that age, but as a parent, there comes a point at which you’re invisible –– some point at which you become a hired guy. That’s the demographic I was channeling: this slightly younger age group, although many reviewers have said, ‘she’s too articulate.’ A character in fiction is not representative of anything. A character is representative of themselves. Do I believe that Julia might exist? I do. Does she seem implausible to me? I wrote her.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">IFJ: <em>You said at the reading that it’s impossible to live the life while writing about it. And Julia, in your novel, says the same thing: it’s a blessing and a curse.</em> </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">CM: Right. You can’t do both at the same time. And well –– it’s like –– I guess it’s changed now, but it’s sort of like being the photographer. It’s the way to insert yourself into an event, if you’re socially anxious: to be able to step behind the camera and take pictures. Which is different now, what with the selfie –– you can enter the frame. But historically, taking the picture meant stepping outside of the frame. And I think that this is the artist’s role. It’s the liminal role. On the threshold.’</p>",

And those were what informed me that this home could never really be just mine, and that one day I would long for something and somewhere else, as Bishop always had. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In one letter Bishop once wrote that she “always felt a sort of guest,” in the places she lived, and if it is late enough at night I wonder if I feel that same way. What happens when you are young is that you begin to realize that the home you grew up in is not your home forever, and you can go back there and it will not feel right. I know that everyone begins to feel this way sooner or later, but one of the blessings of being twenty and living somewhere new for the first time is that it feels like no one else has ever experienced that sense of dislocation before. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p>  <p style=\"text-align: center;\">*</p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I could not tell you when I began to understand all that. But I am talking here about a time when I was sitting in the archives of Houghton Library touching old letters between Bishop and Frank Bidart reading her sad, faded words that described her new apartment near Radcliffe Yard.  It seems to me that the years Bishop lived in Cambridge were her least happy ones and that during that period she must have thought many times of the tall Kapok trees in Sao Paulo and shut her eyes and replayed those days in Petropolis with Lota. Bishop did not want to “write well.” She wrote poetry because she knew of no other mode to express the deep sadness and displacement of her life, pulled perpetually by some “elsewhere”. It would be hard to imagine why Bishop felt strongly towards imaginary oaks and the natural world except that I suppose she saw those trees as comfort because of how they endure, stable and permanent, a foil to her own constant exile.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p>  <p style=\"text-align: center;\">*</p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was nine, ten o’clock in my dusty room on the 11<sup>th</sup> floor of an old building, and I was sitting on the cold linoleum floor when I felt Bishop’s homesickness for a place that no longer belonged to me. She missed Brazil but had left nothing there and I knew I could no longer go back to Marine Street in Manhattan Beach and feel like there was anything left for me. It was forty-seven years ago that Bishop was here in the Brattle Apartments and unhappy in New England, and it is no longer the same place it was when she taught poetry workshops in the Thompson Room in Barker.  To observe these old trees in the Yard over even the short span of time I have been here is to feel that another presence bears witness to our lives. The past and the present connect and history rhymes, taking up space on the sidewalks that line the square.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p>",

		"body" : "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For all the praise that has been to Karl Ove Knausgaard in recent years – and James Wood, in conversation with him at the First Parish in Cambridge, cites him as one of the most lauded foreign novelists of the past decade, alongside Elena Ferrante – he hasn’t gotten enough praise for being a child prodigy. Wood correctly notes that what Knausgaard’s new book, <i>Autumn</i>, immediately reflects is <i>innocence</i>.<br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>Autumn </i>comprises a series of missives to an unborn daughter. It includes dozens of brief and obliquely vivid comments on objects – “Apples,” “Daguerrotype,” “Earth,” “Silence,” and so on. The seeming purpose of this is to give the daughter a solid understanding of what she will have been gotten into. Does the author’s innocence qualify him as an authority? James Wood says that most writers would have been afraid to write the way Knausgaard does of blood’s involvement in blushing. Knausgaard knows his innocence-guilt: “I am very innocent, there are so many things I don’t understand.”</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Is it possible to have a book with no human activity in it?” Knausgaard asked himself, he says, on the way to writing the book. But in \"Apples,\" which he reads, he writes, \"I know that it is never really about the world in itself, merely about our way of relating to it\" (<i>Autumn</i>, page 10). <br>\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">James Wood compares Knausgaard to Tolstoy, referring to their shared simplicity about the natural world, their “natural appetites.” Knausgaard recognizes the influence and cites also Proust, whom he credits with establishing a language for nostalgia. Also the work of Thomas Bernhardt for certain formal elements. Repetition, namely. “Repetition,” repeats Knausgaard.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The audience can eventually ask questions. Knausgaard is asked how he does it. Knausgaard says he wakes up early in the morning. This puts everyone in a good-natured bad humor. <br>\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Knausgaard, although diligent, says that the quality he most seeks in a book is <i>escapism</i>. Asked what he has been reading lately, he says that it has been a lot of books about the Russian Revolution. “It’s all facts but I can get away.” Does he listen to music? “Dad-rock,” he says. Iron & Wine and the War on Drugs. He says that he likes to listen to the same song over and over. The word “revolution” is goofy inasmuch as a complete revolution features a return to the origin. You can see where this is going, backwards. I'm starting to suspect Knaugaard of being a network of nostalgic pulleys.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although Knausgaard apparently likes to escape, he makes sure to keep some distance between himself and paradise. A woman asks him whether he plans to ever come to Argentina, where she's from and evidently lives. She notes that Knausgaard wanted to call \"My Struggle\" \"Argentina,\" but was talked down from it. He confirms this, says he has loved the country since one of its World Cup appearances when he was young. I think he cites the uniform as motive. He says he won’t ever go there.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I feel out of place, because I haven’t read any of Knausgaard’s books, whereas, I take it, lots of the people here have read several thousand pages of his work, mostly more or less about him. One guy starts his question by telling Knausgaard that over the years he has come to care very much about him. I sort of scoff, expecting company, but most people don’t. Many more people laugh when a questioner assures Knausgaard that whereas Knausgaard has insisted that his memory is poor, it actually can’t be. Knausgaard clarifies: as he writes about the past he comes to remember more of it. He also says that the access-points to memory tend to come through highly physical recollections – what it was like to run as a child, etc. – and then he can work from there. There is an interesting way in which this mnemonic physicality corresponds to the “natural appetites” whose expression in Tolstoy accounts for much relatability in his work, as well as to the conceptual naturalism of <i>Autumn</i>’s descriptions of the world.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Something about Knausgaard’s work is highly relatable. The audience treats him like an old friend. It sometimes has a bluntness. One man spends a long time talking about how he thinks that all decisions are moral decisions – Knausgaard says that he feels always guilt – then asks Knausgaard, From reading you it’s obvious that you’re an alcoholic, do you still drink?  </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wonder whether it is exhausting for someone who must think so much about himself to be surrounded by people who spend a lot of time thinking about him. Maybe he thinks that when we’re thinking of him, we are trying to make autobiographical fan fiction about him. Maybe he isn’t sure his own work isn’t fan-fictive. “It is impossible to trust memory,” says our memoirist, “because memory makes you into something you can live with.” I start to wonder what a genre of “Knausgaard fan fiction” would comprise. The questions finish. After this disheveling onslaught, before coming back to sign books, Knausgaard cuts out for a cigarette. No one asked him if he smokes.  </p>",

But his manager is happy to put this writer and a photographer on the list for Sumney’s Monday performance at the Sinclair. Her message  - or maybe it’s Sumney’s - seems pretty clear. Meet the musician through his music. Questions can come later. (Another possibility is that the Harvard Advocate isn’t exactly the sort of media outlet that Sumney, fresh from collaborations with Solange and Beck, and recent mastermind behind the genre-defying soul/folk/synth/choral creation that is <i>Aromanticism,</i> is going to entertain. But you can decide for yourself.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tAnyway, we go. They are, after all, free tickets to a Moses Sumney concert.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/DSC_0689.JPG\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; width: 570px; height: 380px;\" alt=\"\" width=\"570\" height=\"380\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\" rel=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Live, Sumney embodies the same certainty that an interview refusal kind of implies. He jokes with the crowd, he heckles, he splits the audience of mostly-college students to self select into a two-part harmony by asking us whether or not we were rejected by Harvard College. Apologetic silence, is the answer. Moses must devise another way to create his chorus.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> “Under 22, you sing this note—“ he sings it, pretty low, “And the real adults, you sing this one.” It is somewhat higher. He shoots a joke off in Spanish; from behind me comes a shouted, “claro que si!” and Sumney adjusts his mike, picks up the lyric again.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tThere’s incredible humility and intimacy required for someone to lyrically admit, as Moses Sumney does, that, “I don’t know if I am worth it.” But he admits, and admits again, and it  suddenly seems that the performative humor, flirtation, the bravado, is a way to step back from the incredible permission that songs like, “Lonely World;” “Self-Help Tape;” and “Worth It” afford the listener. Swaying under the blue-purple light of the Sinclair’s flickering stage, Sumney raises his arms in a sort of invitation like the pastor’s son he actually is, and the whole house breaks into song. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\tHere are some more nice pictures, taken in the hope that maybe this brief article will pop up on Sumney’s Google Alerts. Although, if one concert is enough to go on, Sumney seems like the kind of person who doesn’t need the internet to remind him that he might be worth it.

The car behind them stopped and the driver got out. “Shit shit shit,” said Ariana, the <i>Advocate</i>’s Art Editor. “They’re gonna fight.” The guy stomped up to the driver’s window of the car in front of him and affectionately embraced the driver through his window. Our uber driver whistled. “I thought he was going to deck him,” he said. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A minute passed. “Do you even like Takashi Murakami?” my friend Sam, art board member, asked quietly. I thought about it. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"368\" height=\"498\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; width: 368px; height: 498px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“No.” </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Me either.” </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But there we were, suddenly at the MFA. There were a lot of bright lights, and a lot of people smoking out front where signs said you weren’t supposed to smoke. We trekked on over two lawns, a parking lot, and the ramp for trucks with large deliveries to get to the press entrance. The scene: artsy yuppies, and artsier yuppies. Maybe toss in a couple actual bona-fide art students (are we in that category? All of them looked like the people I encountered on the street in Bushwick this summer and felt endemically less cool than). All of them, except the people I expected were art students, were taking selfies in this relatively visually uninteresting hallway of the contemporary wing. We took a selfie. I ponied up for a $9 glass of wine and we stood in the general vicinity of our first of the night’s three DJ booths. Men were leading that dance where you move your fists in circles around each other in front of your chest. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We went upstairs. The Rothko exhibit was closed, and so was the Annette Lemieux. “Aw,” said Ariana, and crouched as if to crawl under the stanchion keeping us back from the glass door. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We looped back downstairs and walked through the Works on Paper room and the Art of Asia, Oceania, and Africa wing to get to the rotunda, and then emerged into the large room with the café and the lime green Dale Chihuly piece. It was packed, thanks to the second of the three DJs. Projected smiling rainbow flowers fifteen feet in diameter and made of light rotated in slow motion above our heads. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We decided it was time to see the art. Downstairs a group of people were gathered around a girl sitting on the floor, wringing their hands. We opened the double doors and walked promptly into two guards in eagle stance. My knee-jerk reaction was “performance art?” and then one of them looked me in the eye and said “Watch where you step.” I looked down. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"551\" height=\"413\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; width: 551px; height: 413px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What was most interesting about the two pools of vomit behind the guards was that there were two of them, and that they were equally sized, about five feet apart. You imagined that the poor girl had opened the doors, seen the massive painting behind her, and out of sheer revulsion had emptied the contents of her stomach on the carpet. And then she had looked back up, moved five feet to the right to get a different angle on the piece, and been overcome with aesthetic nausea once again. And <i>then </i>they had removed her. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I think the vomit put us in a flippant mood toward the art. “It’s covered in dust” said one of us about one of the <i>Superflat </i>works<i>. </i>“Dust!” We debated the wall texts. I spent a long time looking at the Heiji Scroll. I liked this caption especially. It was short and to the point.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/4.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"418\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; width: 550px; height: 418px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The show bottlenecked in <i>Flower Lamps. </i>A lot of people were lying on the flower-covered floor of the installation having new profile pictures taken from above. The wall next to it had text that said “If you don’t share a photo from this exhibition, did you really visit? Above the text, there were four circles with the logos of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat. Our deities. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/5.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"395\" height=\"561\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; width: 395px; height: 561px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We retreated to the Buddhist temple on the second floor, where we stayed for fifteen minutes in total silence. We decided to leave.<br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/6.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"527\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; width: 396px; height: 527px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the exit, we were asked to take a colorful candy from a bucket which represented the aspect of the evening we had liked the most. There was silver for “ART-MAKING,” gold for “MUSIC,” blue for “EXHIBITIONS,” purple for “INTERACTIVE ACTIVITIES,” red for “DANCING,” and green for “FOOD AND DRINKS.” I hadn’t realized there had been art-making or interactive activities. Food and drinks was relatively full, which seemed like retribution for the exorbitant pricing. I took a red one, Sam took a blue, and Ariana took a purple. We popped them into their mouths. “Ew, grape,” said Ariana. “I didn’t realize they were different <i>flavors.</i>” She frowned. “Do you think I can get another?” </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“You made your choice,” said Sam. Mine was strawberry. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/7.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"514\" height=\"386\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; width: 514px; height: 386px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Out front, super-powerful projectors were flooding the museum’s façade with spinning flowers and Murakami’s name in huge letters. The characteristic flash of emergency services was encroaching on the display as an ambulance pulled up, shortly followed by a fire truck. Someone was being wheeled around the sidewalk in a shopping cart, yelling “Wheeeee!” the whole way. <br></p>",

The band is, to put it simply, relatable and <i>easy</i> to enjoy- even if and maybe because sometimes it’s all blended together in a folk-jazz-indie kombucha mix.</p>  <p>But their tour's House of Blues gig last Monday night (led by front man <a href=\"http://www.johndarnielle.com/\">Darnielle</a> and opened by Mothers) absolutely shattered any expectations I had- and <i>only</i>, somehow, in ways that had me wondering why I don’t listen more.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: center;\" rel=\"text-align: center;\"><i>*****</i></p>    <p>Mothers, a(nother) folk indie/rock group out of Georgia opened the gig to an already packed house, who while enthusiastic were - bummer for Mothers - also pretty clearly impatient. Kristine Leschper (Mothers' lead singer, though she also plays guitar) had a great, somehow familiar, voice for the and their vibe, the latter of which best exemplified by moving shots projected on HoB’s back curtain; a mix of the last California desert-themed music video you saw and an undergrad art installation. (The best part was the texture from the curtain.) But while her voice was promising, the tracks were largely rhythm-driven, and though Mothers started out with promise – at least B+ jam band grade – the tempo control was sometimes out of sync and frenetic in a jarring way. On the other hand, some moments worked really well towards the end of the set, though my impression likely had something to do with contrast.</p>  <p>To be clear, none of this is to say that individually speaking Mothers’ members are not good at what they do! Actually, Matthew Anderegg (their drummer) crushed it several times. The two last songs of their set especially saw him take a control, which only made me wonder why he wasn’t front and center more. But as a group the chemistry was (i) sometimes off, (ii) sometimes straight up dysfunctional, and (iii) only on occasion worthy of the potential they clearly have.</p>  <p>Last thing before the main event (See? You’re antsy too): Generally, I’m loathe in a gig review to comment on a set’s technical elements, since most times that’s the purview of the venue and not the band. That said, since it was such a glaring part of my experience of Mothers, I have to say that some of the between-song transitions were spectacularly awkward. And when at the end of the gig the lights went on, and Leschper, Anderegg, and the others (Drew Kirby and Chris Goggins) started cleaning up their own stuff, the move struck me as inelegantly sophomoric. Especially for the House of Blues.</p>  <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">tl;dr, give them a listen, but don’t rush to see Mothers live.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">*****<br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p>    <p><img src=\"/media/tmp/IMG_5650.jpg\" style=\"width: 564px; height: 424px; display: block; margin: auto;\" width=\"564\" height=\"424\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Inasmuch as they informed the crowd’s vibe, and ranged from spectacularly awkward to blissfully cool, tbh transitions constituted an enormous element of Monday’s gig and its vibe. Luckily, the transition from Mothers to the Mountain Goats, when the latter got into their set, was far to the “blissfully cool” end of my spectrum.</p>  <p>Without putting down Mothers, I’d say it like this: where the opening act was people playing music, the Mountain Goats were musicians playing a <i>Show</i>, capital S. </p>  <p>That said, my last comment goes primarily for when the group was onstage together, since there were two (not <i>bad</i>, but definitely <i>meh)</i> moments that did pretty much nothing for them or the Show. The first was the pre-opening, set before the Mountain Goats came on to a blackout stage with two candelabras (Phantom of the Opera style), and a Vivaldi Sonata<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>, lilting over a crowd of (vocally) confused fans. As a lapsed classical violinist, Vivaldi is always a pleasure. As a concert-goer and critic, it was unnecessary, since the first piece of the set (<i>The Grey King and the Silver Flame Attunement</i>, from their new album Goths) would’ve served the same chill purpose – it’s one of their slower, jazzier tunes – but its refrain “And I’m hardcore, but I’m not that hardcore” then almost felt like it was poking fun at the distinctly <i>not</i> hardcore<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> pre-opening bit.</p>  <p>But they charged on, and the transition from first to second song (<i>Cotton</i>, one of my personal faves) gave a hint to the prodigious display of musicianship in store – Darnielle and Matt Douglas (Douglas is by far the most musically talented of the bunch) both changed instruments – and the switch from jazzy with <i>The Grey King</i> to indie folk pop with <i>Cotton</i> was seamless, and exciting to watch. The second awkward moment was Darnielle’s solo set. As a lead singer he’s unlikely, and hilarious – think bare feet and a beer by the mic – but with the Mountain Goats on stage he could not be more charismatic. Alone, one the other hand, he has nobody to riff off of (he tried, tbf, with someone in the audience) and in ways the few songs felt less like a show than a recital.</p>  <p>But the post-solo set (starting with <i>Snow Crush Killing Song</i>, an awesome, jazzy song from their 1995 album Sweden) began with the best transition of all (maybe because it was a relief after the solo set to hear them all back together), and they continued to jam out for a boundlessly enthusiastic crowd another six more songs, ending in <i>Against Pollution</i> (another favorite) before they were called back for two (count em) encore sets.</p>  <p>The new MG album “Goths,” which they're promoting with the tour, is full of a consistent and varied energy. Check out Rain in Soho, to hear them pull off the impossible with some hardcore folk, and Paid in Cocaine for a jazzy jam I've had on repeats at kickbacks since first listen. There are more jazz/pop elements than I’ve ever heard from the Mountain Goats before, but they stick otherwise to the subversive, genius lyricism and high-skill-without-trying-too-hard cohesion that brought em fame (and you can definitely see why when their track record's so long, and so damn good.) I've been listening to the Mountain Goats for years now, and the whole show (minus those few nit-pickable moments) transformed how I hear their digital music by imbuing it with the echo of an unreal performance energy. That energy, I think, has only just now truly come out on LP with Goths, and is one on a list of reasons I'd recommend it. Otherwise, grab tix as soon as they're near you to transform listening.</p>  <p style=\"text-align: center;\" rel=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">tl;dr Their sticker is now on my computer.

Unless I say otherwise – and it’d take a productive imagination to think up any relevant scenario(s) – these bits are reviewing specific gigs; <i>not</i> the group, band, whatever you want to call it, that’s performing outside of how they present <i>at</i> the gig and how that jives with prior exposure. Before any of the reviews, if I haven’t already, I listen to relevant discographies, but unless I wanna take a God-like stance on “getting” the dynamics of a group from one measly gig (let me assure you I do not, don’t think my rabbi would be down w that anyway) these reviews are just reviews of the gigs they purport to cover. EOM.</p>    <p>Having prefaced this then, I have to say that Monday night was not a great gig. Monday night at Atwood’s Tavern was the wrong venue, physically, technically and emotionally, for both Jenny O. and The Solars (who opened). Think sparse attendance, mediocre lighting, and enough tech malfunctions to have Jenny (of Jenny O.) audibly joke “this is terrible!!” and call a (not-joking) SOS into the audience.</p>    <p>In not so many words, my experience of the music was high-key mitigated by the venue’s graceless setup, and the gig suffered accordingly. That said, though Atwood’s was a brutal spot, I’m really impressed with the way Jenny O.* specifically (*that designator’s gonna have to mean the whole band, including the bassist and drummer whose names are nowhere on Jenny O.’s <a href=\"http://jennyo.com/\">site</a>) handled some glaring and disruptive SNAFUs<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>, and produced seriously high-quality music throughout.</p>    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">*****</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p>    <p>The Solars, fronted by virtuoso Miles Hewitt, opened (a little late) to a <i>very</i> small crowd. There were maybe seven heads in the bar; another three if you count those who had only come for the beer. But, they went with it, and to be honest the venue fit their still gleefully sophomoric, or at least generally undergraduate, vibe.</p>    <p>Hewitt has an unreal voice, reminiscent of the vocals on Alt-J’s <i>An Awesome Wave</i>, and I was keenly aware (especially in the beginning of the set) of the fact that Atwood’s swallowed his voice, and the music, unfairly somehow. He was in charge of banter, of lead-man guitar, and of half the vocals- which he shared with another femme singer (Sydney Lee?) who added her voice to the soundstage with an insouciant, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dounia/\">Dounia</a>-like vibe. Separately, both voices were strong and touchingly earnest, but together (and this was a recurring theme) at best not as good and at worst straight-up disappointingly discordant.</p>    <p>Hewitt + the bassist, the drummer and the brass/synth player (names unclear) were easily the core of the band, and led a surprisingly diverse set that’d best have been described as the basement-concert love child of <a href=\"http://www.altjband.com/\">Alt. J</a> and <a href=\"http://beirutband.com/\">Beirut</a>. Towards the end of the set The Solars played some of their newer stuff – Queen of the Suburbs, Independence Day, etc. – to applause about as enthusiastic as a 7-person audience can muster, well deserved. The stuff from their newest EP, <i>Retitled Remastered</i> (go look, if only for the cover art) which <a href=\"https://digboston.com/the-best-local-albums-of-2017-so-far/\">Digboston</a> said “could be the first of several signs that The Solars would, and then did, make it big” was by far the best of the live set, and at second listen the best of their recorded stuff, too.</p><p><br></p>    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">tl;dr they deserved better than Atwood’s, and will also for the foreseeable future be on repeat when I smoke.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/IMG_E5915.jpg\" style=\"width: 466px; height: 623px;\" width=\"466\" height=\"623\"></p>    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">*****</p>    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">After The Solars Jenny O., on with the other two thirds of her three-piece, opened on a California indie-rock influenced track that couldn’t have sounded more professional, and couldn’t have bopped any harder (if that can be said about indie-rock) if she’d skipped the gig and played a studio recording of the song so she could share a beer with the (still-small) crowd. I was <a href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/6L651p3BQKdXi/giphy.gif\">high-key</a> impressed. The vocals were somewhat obscured under the music, which was a bummer because (i) you could only understand every fourth word she said, and (ii) the music was really well-executed but for the most part a little repetitive, and her voice sounded like it could’ve been the antidote to the follow-on fatigue. Even obscured though, her voice mellowed throughout the first song until by the end she’d reached a chill honey-toned croon (that’s not the right word, imagine the way someone in Portland would croon to a coffee house-themed venue) and the room was silent, just listening.</p>    <p>But then, the indie-rock hit the fan. Between the first and second songs Jenny O., like Hewitt, was in charge of banter and came off like an artist playing a TV version of herself on Girls (it was endearing, that’s not as bad as it sounded.) She tuned up with her bassist, looked to her to start the next track, and (actually the Girls analogy still works here, the bassist looked like a smaller, mildly stoned Jemima Kirke) they got, maybe, 15 seconds in? Before the sound gave out, as in almost completely, to the point where everything stopped and Jenny O. was left (I’ve already mentioned this but it’s worth mentioning twice) calling an “SOS” into the audience. None came. To their credit, the band handled the SNAFU as gracefully as might have been hoped, but it was nearly ten minutes before anything started up again and by the time they made their recovery the room had shifted from awkward to impatient and back again, and I (for one) was relieved to be reminded of the pretense under which we’d all come through. </p>    <p>Their first recovery was actually a real high-point in the set, great sound, an awesome vibe (again with the relief) and a control of rhythm and groove that would’ve been impressive anyway even if they hadn’t just spent ten minutes flailing in front of a <i>very</i> small crowd. When they came back on, I noticed (especially in contrast to The Solars) that where Jenny O.’s voice was great, it was even better in moments of overlap with her bassist’s singing, and again both got (even) better with time. The third and fourth tracks (at time of writing, I have no set list, and the lyrics were unintelligible so they’re hard to search) demonstrated a wild diversity of sound- especially considering that they stayed comfortably in the cali indie-rock genre. There was a great bass solo in the third, and the fourth song had by far the best vocals of the night.</p>    <p>But, even after the first, major crisis, the tech SNAFUs were constant. Honestly, I wasn’t disposed to blame them or be disappointed (in anything/one but the tech) as they all (Jenny O. in particular) continued to demonstrate an extraordinary capacity for endearing awkwardness, with banter (“this is really awkward!”) and more music (at one point the bassist and drummer jammed to cover the silence, some of their best rhythm work tbh). That said, where I wrote at one point that it seemed like the more awkward the transition, the better the next song would be, after an hour I was too distracted by the sound issues and the noise in the venue to get what I had been getting from the music.</p><p><br></p>    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">tl;dr was not the night for them, but I’d listen on a drive to the beach and am crossing my fingers that they’ve reached their cosmic quota on tech <a href=\"https://www.dailywritingtips.com/the-yiddish-handbook-40-words-you-should-know/\">mishegas</a>.</p>  <p><br>  </p><hr>      <p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> SNAFU: Situation Normal All Fucked Up</p>",

The anthem, sung by concertgoer Kayla M. Salmon, was the highlight of an impromptu talent show hosted by Coast Modern, Tuesday night’s headliner in The Sinclair. This goofy, no-stakes “talent show” was the perfect icebreaker that seemed to forewarn the audience, “Don’t take anything you are about to see or hear too seriously.” And there’s nothing serious about Coast Modern. </p><p><br>\r\n</p><p><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\">From Los Angeles, Coast Modern is an indie pop band that sounds like they are from Los Angeles. Their music is an amorphous mixture of mischievous energy and dog-day lethargy. To hear this contradiction, listen to a track from their eponymous <u><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/394iVM0BcR0DTb8AoNijdg?\" target=\"_blank\">debut album</a></u> released last year. The band consists of lead singer Coleman Trapp and guitarist Luke Atlas - who, by the way, was presumably the man in black spandex. </span></p><p><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"><br></span>\r\n</p><p><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\">But first, let’s briefly discuss the evening’s impressive opener, a three-person pop band called SHAED from Washington D.C. The lead singer Chelsea Lee was a powerhouse. She instantly captured the audience's attention and held it with her clear and bold vocals. <span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"><br></span></span>\r\n</p><p><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"><br></span></span>\r\n</p><p rel=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/_DSC5427.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; width: 100%\"></span></span>\r\n</p><p><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"><br></span></span></span>\r\n</p><p><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\">After SHAED’s set, the audience was sufficiently riled up in anticipation of the headliner. Lava lamps, giant tangerine gummy bears, and yellow neon palm trees were brought onto the stage as props, adding to the funky atmosphere. The lights dimmed, and the audience cheered as Coast Modern rushed onto the stage. Their set opened with \"Tiny Umbrella,\" setting a course through a psychedelic journey. <span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"><br></span></span></span></span>\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p><img src=\"/media/tmp/_DSC5453.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; width: 100%;\">\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p> If there’s one word that can describe Trapp and Atlas, it would be “confident.” There’s no question that the moment they walked onto that stage, they owned it. Trapp was charismatic and energetic: It was hard for me to get good photos because of how much he bounced around the stage. However, what made fans particularly obsessed with Coast Modern was the band’s continuous audience interaction. Trapp pulled the audience into Coast Modern's California utopia through jokes, banters, and playing games with fans. <br>\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p><img src=\"/media/tmp/_DSC5471.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; width: 100%\">\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p><img src=\"/media/tmp/_DSC5481.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; width: 100%\">\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p><img src=\"/media/tmp/_DSC5536_AVVC8SW.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; width: 100% ;\"><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"></span>\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p><img src=\"/media/tmp/_DSC5583.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; width: 100%\">\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><img src=\"/media/tmp/_DSC5629.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; width: 100%;\"><p><br>\r\n</p><p>Crowd-pleasers that night were \"Dive,\" \"The Way It Was,\" \"Run It Up,\" and a cover of \"Electric Feel.\" Though perhaps the song that garnered the largest reactions from the crowd was a cover of Aretha Franklin's \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" sung unexpectedly by Atlas. Despite a technological mishap partway through, Coast Modern performed well with seamless transitions. Overall, it was a great concert and a great venue. The bands started on time and stayed after the show to greet their many fans. </p><p><br>\r\n</p><p>To stay updated on Coast Modern, be sure to like their <u><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/coastmodernmusic/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></u> and follow their <u><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/coastmodernmusic/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></u>.

It kind of felt like the Powers That Be had pushed back Twain's stage time (they were opening for Darlingside) to do a late-night sound check, or like the venue had been delaying things with a recorded set list but the speakers had conked out. Even with the low audience hum, it was <i>that</i> quiet, and there was that little energy. And having listened to Twain’s label debut with Keeled Scales (<em>Rare Feeling</em><i> </i>(2017), more info <a href=\"https://www.allmusic.com/album/rare-feeling-mw0003115737\">here</a>) a few times through now, the reality of their live performance was awkward; I had been expecting the coherent, and (occasionally) profoundly listenable sound that defines tracks like \"Solar Pilgrim\" and \"Freed from Doubt,\" and instead found myself struggling to follow along. </p>  <p>I'm sympathetic, though; all it takes is a coffee house experience or two to know that it's really, <em>profoundly</em> hard for acoustic groups to command attention, when that attention isn’t already there. And for that sound to have to fill an electric space, like the Sinclair’s? People have to <i>want</i> to listen, or they won't. In other words, Twain faced an uphill battle from moment one. Those tracks I could make out weren’t bad (kind of a mix of California grunge rock and Bon Iver, see similar albums <a href=\"https://www.allmusic.com/album/rare-feeling-mw0003115737/similar\">here</a>), but the group failed where others have come through in that they were just too young, and too nervous to hit their stride. </p>  <p>Tl;dr, Would recommend Twain if you ever need to out-chill that guy who's played Bon Iver six tracks in a row. Spotify will suffice tho, live set was not a mood. </p>    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/darlingside%202.png\" width=\"511\" height=\"399\" style=\"width: 511px; height: 399px;\"></p><br>    <p>I was nervous after Twain, having listened to Darlingside’s stuff (everything from <em>Pilot Machines</em> to <em>Birds Say </em><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\">to <em>Whipporwill</em></span>), that they were going to have a similar issue filling the Sinclair's space. Granted, my first encounter with the foursome - four years removed from Thursday night (they played for an admitted students’ weekend at their alma mater, Williams College) - had been electric. That should have assuaged my fears, but circumstances don't always translate. </p>  <p>And then, they started playing. Within moments of the lighting cue (a black stage gave way to flashing, naked bulbs) I remembered why “Blow the House Down” has been on my default playlist since 2014; Twain’s issue was that they couldn’t fill the stage or the space, but when Darlingside sings (and all of them do; Don Mitchell, Auyon Mukharji, Harris Paseltiner, and David Senft), they take up <em>even less</em> square footage, and yet <em>still</em> somehow manage to get at the cheap seats. The coordination between them (during the opening, but also throughout) was so profound that I’d honestly back them in a synchronized swimming event, whenever. That goes for the vocals, but it goes even more so for the instrumental element on show; every member was singing throughout, but they also switched instruments early and often. At one point, David Senft was playing bass <em>and</em> kick drum <em>while</em> he sang. (I nearly went home to put up my own guitar on ebay.) </p>  <p>The Williams alums, now Boston-based, opened with \"Singularity” (from their new album <em>Extralife</em><i>)</i>. Might be nostalgia, but before Thursday I would've called myself partial to early Darlingside; now, I'm not sure. <em>Extralife </em><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\">is a masterpiece.</span> In one interview, NPR called it “sumptuous,” with “harmony-heavy songs.” But performed live, those harmonies (primarily vocal) are if anything secondary to Darlingside's heart-pounding rhythm, kept afloat by intense musicianship and active communication. Also, I know I've knocked them before, so I should mention that there was a good show by the venue’s lighting team, too; at the end of “My Gal, My Guy” (from <em>Birds Say</em> (2015)) the final note lined up with a neat black out, and there were projected white lights dancing on (and above) the audience all night. </p>  <p>Other highlights of the gig included “Futures” (<em>Extralife</em>), and the geographic non-sequitor “Good for You” (<em>Birds Say</em>). The best moment though was perhaps Paseltiner’s cello solo before “Harrison Ford” (also from <em>Birds Say</em>), which led into an incredible musical peak (even if the lyrics varied in their comprehensibility between being clear-as-day and greek-to-me, short-story Hemingway and theory-heavy Lacan). As a matter of fact, I’d be remiss not to put a brief spotlight on Paseltiner for his part in the gig as a whole; Darlingside is emphatically and impressively focused on the collective (the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/harmonious\">New Yorker</a> called them a \"rigorously egalitarian foursome\"), but the classically-trained cellist stood out in most every moment. </p>  <p>Other than the music, should also say that the banter was unusually strong. Two songs in there was a bit on Barritt’s (like, the ginger beer) that’ll probably make me think of Darlingside now every time I see a can. And towards the end, Mukharji introduced the members with bits of Waltham trivia assigned to each (amongst his references were El Taqueria Amigo, Waltham Tattoo, the band Waltham, and the Waltham watch company). The monologue could’ve been written for the Onion, and watching Mitchell, Paseltiner, and Senft watch him was (forgive the cheese) heart-warming. </p>  <p>Tl;dr, if you haven’t already, I would definitely give a listen to Darlingside (<em>Extralife </em>and <em>Birds Say</em>,<i> </i>in particular). Also, check in on <a href=\"http://www.darlingside.com/shows/\">tickets</a>! They’re selling out fast, and I couldn't recommend the experience more highly. </p><p><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\" rel=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/Darlingside3.png\" width=\"412\" height=\"621\" style=\"width: 412px; height: 621px;\"></p><br>",

Olsen is here, here being Europe, to promote <em>Phases, </em>2017’s collection of folk/rock anthems that didn’t make it into her four previous albums. It’s a tour for the fans, who’ve filled the thousand seat theatre. She promises the crowd she’ll play any song we like. I catch myself wondering if anyone else is having an out-of-body experience. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Like the Orpheum in San Francisco or Boston’s own Opera House, Madrid’s Calderon is capped with a neck-achingly beautiful ceiling and impossibly low-backed seats. The fluttering vibrato of Olsen’s voice in “Iota,” and even the power-ballad of “Never Be Mine” are swallowed up. Standing is difficult: the chairs, which are covered in dark velvet, keep everyone firmly anchored in place and exactly one arm-rest away from the nearest neighbor. In the 17th century, the Calderon was actually an order of Trinitarian monks; in 2018, it is still impossible to dance there. </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em></em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/_MG_4180_jB1G51v.jpg\" width=\"681\" height=\"455\" style=\"width: 681px; height: 455px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Photography by </em><em>Viltė Vaitkutė</em><br><em></em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p><p>Cradling her guitar against the buttons of a black smock, Olsen’s stage presence – feet braced, straight-talking, All-American – feels incongruous in the middle of all that finery. She tells the crowd about her morning: how she walked through the “big park,” (meaning, the Parque Retiro) and wandered into a nice art museum (the Prado) to look at some “pretty nice stuff.” I want to understand that she’s joking, I want to know that she’s doing what I did on the first string of Tinder dates here - play American ignorant and let the other person show you the town - but then she asks the crowd if they’ll make her a plate of paella. This is much like going to the States and asking a Californian if they’ll throw you a New England clam bake. Someone actually hisses. <br></p><p><em></em></p><p><br></p><p>I started listening to Olsen on the futon of my high school bedroom, waiting for a text from the boy I was trying to date, volume turned on high to drown out the sounds of the football game floating in from the nearby city college. In high school the angst of Olsen’s lyrics (sample line: “I am the one now”) made a very specific kind of sense: e.g: “I have to save my life.” <br></p><p><br>I particularly loved a song called “High Five,” whose combination of punchy but geekily proud lyrics, “Are you lonely too? High five/ So am I,” made me feel like dancing and crying and taking a bunch of pictures. The lucky recipient of both photos and lyrics was my best friend, whose Spotify feed regularly alternated between Nico, Leonard Cohen, and the Velvet Underground - not necessarily in that order. In response to the Olsen lyrics, she texted back the laughing emoji and the words <em>LOL – sad. </em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/media/tmp/_MG_4203_DdJMqm0.jpg\" width=\"681\" height=\"455\" style=\"width: 681px; height: 455px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Photography by </em><em>Viltė Vaitkutė</em><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p><p>Onstage in the Spanish theatre, Olsen also laughs about the navel-gazey quality of her music. “I was twenty-three, you know, living in Chicago and waitressing and sad.” This is apparently enough to transition to her next song, which is equally introspective and, one might even say, sad. Sitting in the theatre as an almost-twenty one year old who is no longer so depressed, I realize what disappoints me in all of this is the disclaimer. Olsen is now thirty-one; she is concluding a world tour; it must be difficult to re-resurrect old relationships every time she steps up to the microphone; but who comes to see Angel Olsen in Madrid if they are not also a little bit “lonely too?” </p><p><br></p><p>Holding a hand up to shield her eyes, the folk singer peers out across the crowd, a sea of people that almost certainly includes more than one homesick North American. She smiles: “No, I can’t sing this without laughing.” But then she does: and the music flies up into the gold-embossed ceiling of the Teatro Calderon, where I crane my neck to watch it go. <em></em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><br></em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>If you’re looking to see Olsen on N. American soil, she’ll be <a href=\"https://angelolsen.com/\">back</a> in the United States come June for the start of her Dreams tour. She’ll start in North Carolina on June 5th and close out in Massachussets at Mass MOCA on September 29th.</em>  </p>",

As Boston’s festival goers descend upon the complex, the smell of fried food, sweat, and just a whiff of the ganja permeates the air. But why do people come to music festivals? For the star-studded line up or for those strange moments of community found in the ever-pushing crowd? For the Insta/snap story or for the time with friends? For the likes or for what they like? And perhaps more importantly, what makes music festivals special? Are they like a lunch buffet special that is only appealing in combining everything for one, reasonable package-price? Or is a music festival greater than the sum of its events? <br></p><p><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/zEMV1DkZb4GwsnneTG8qCTk8snKJVSz-sztCxBa2cTSXkRpu8hlH84d1_TNcgV4fGwsqisa7lxhulZZoEP5R07CwYdpE9eCNXnZHlO8npe7p8yNxRAx23zgvt1kzn_hkEwa-TnJ1\" width=\"463\" height=\"693\" style=\"width: 463px; height: 693px;\"></p><p><br></p><p>On Friday afternoon, Noname performed on the green stage. In her set, she was visibly intoxicated, apologizing many times for her drunkenness. Yet her set was one of the true highlights of the festival, as it offered an uncommon portrait of an artist. Everything that was lost to slurred speech was more than made up for in seeing the artist as the artist is not often seen. As Noname performed fan favorites such as, “Diddy Bop” and “Shadow Man,” the audience got to hear them as they had not heard them before, drunkenly slurred in the most endearing of ways. While many were sure to ‘story’ the moment on their various apps, it is the indelible memory of the drunken Noname that will remain in my mind. It is at this point that I would like to give a special mention to Noname’s band, who did an absolute bang-up job of keeping up with her intoxication and managing to match her meandering vocals throughout the turbulent set. </p><p><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/HuTEE4kfgFmY71PHA7_zM5cvL3ZvvAXCQhSGJfHOcc1VBYi1dwu0RT3u8ZZC0aAHtDlXMToiuajEjk2vjmeAMxS4G7KUU7oWin5z5IxCjGuX-_GEf3__-tRXRjoyzCOM38cUugpW\" width=\"590\" height=\"393\" style=\"width: 590px; height: 393px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/YEohxKlpP2MznL8ukbd7IlyTdMf_QkMZgq-y0vrQGqRKXbD_zzd5gNb25eZ7mlWYTNQemID5unnsqqjksRSP6BgZHIcw8bgiiuSTx9dZq6l_h8K5bpSq48NJnnrkrRj0TLMtZcHl\" width=\"589\" height=\"392\" style=\"width: 589px; height: 392px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p><p>Portugal. The Man was next on the red stage and brought many questions with their performance. While they performed their hits, and surely pleased the crowd, their on-screen visuals brought to question the very nature of the quintessential festival performance. While the typical festival headliner will offer platitudes in favor of the host city, “I love Boston” and the like, Portugal. The Man performed their entire set without once properly addressing the audience. In lieu of in-person engagement, their set featured giant text laid over colorful graphics. The text divorced the band from the audience by doing their job for them. One particularly memorable message ran, “We love you, [Insert city name here].” This was one of many moments which lead me to question the nature of festivals themselves. Do they exist for convenience sake, merely the amalgamation of several shows, or is a festival more than the sum of its concerts? </p><p><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3k95igcluNOasKaTSoAvkcdu4G0KMVxteB-63yhgDDz5yqpcAqxxyvh0iINHT0rPuLnAlnltIJP1PgQuv8__465vcPYPPKkdqEzUbxfSP9lnlV8yT_Muq5NSBn4nmP3uf0G4oqso\" width=\"595\" height=\"335\" style=\"width: 595px; height: 335px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p><p>During Saturday’s headlining performance by The Killers, another such unique moment struck. Near halfway through their set, The Killers’ drummer, Ronnie Vanucci Jr. was tired. So tired was he, that a member of the audience was invited on-stage to take over for the next song. Nick, as our savior was known, killed it. He even did a drum solo. It was a powerful thing to see the entire audience of thousands hold their collective breath in anticipation of some teenager of whom they did not know five minutes prior. As Nick hit those drums, every member of the audience felt closer to The Killers. For that one song, one of us was one of them, and we were all one thing together. </p><p><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Akf-AhYI_5C_ruRPfIgIO4zDZM80af0y7g7GKlODrd9KSQAhBupbFv5Tt1yTVsGHS0Gq1piXFf7hv9XjIOgPvVynAxxO2CPhdxwCT6VcmBUxZQkacV0njbANH-a8kuWsEUk4oBxt\" width=\"561\" height=\"374\" style=\"width: 561px; height: 374px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p><p>The degree of separation between audience and artist is a difficult thing to analyze. While many media-consumers feel closer than ever to their musical idols through official snapchat and Instagram stories, the increasingly “Truman Show”-esque fascination with which fans look into musicians’ lives can have the effect of separating audiences and artists even further. In a world of increasing participation in social media, it is easy to view festivals as vapid searches for likes, views, and general clout. Festivals can be a place to be seen as much as to see. Yet at the same time, it is through festivals that many people are attempting to close the distance between those artists that inspire them and themselves. At Boston Calling, we saw artists debut new material, perform drunk, and ultimately engage with their fans in novel ways. These are often unique aspects of festival performances and can be difficult to replicate on solo tours. While modern music festivals can seem like maddening searches to see and be seen, they can be so much more. The modern music festival has the power to bring together audience and artist, fan and figure. The modern music festival is more than the sum of its sets. </p><p><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/IHBFbNuHb6rK-Hb_4EZ7U5qLaJAgbMkgWn72cColEifNQQyAPE9Hzg_dyEtxPnuJZwYOuV0RMtq0Pj77UzMw74_mZ8AnsVQXAANGSjXeYXH-F4-ObX4FAUrW_jLga1JgNfmC-_N7\" width=\"519\" height=\"772\" style=\"width: 519px; height: 772px;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br></p>",

		"title" : "Poems Big and Small: Louise Glück at the Barker Center",
		"slug" : "louisegluckatthebarkercenter",
		"body" : "<p>Like most famous people, Louise Glück is shorter than I expected. At Glück’s reading on April 10th in the Barker center, the room was so packed I had to sit on the floor. From this vantage, I had a better view of the audience than of the stage, such that when Glück arrived, what I saw first was not the poet herself, but the awed looks that followed her into the room, signaling that this, this mild and unassuming figure, was the Poet Laureate, the Louise Glück.<br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Glück’s reading was a study in contrasts. The poems were packed with the first-person, existential intensity that characterizes her work. Yet in performance, she read her work in a slow, husky monotone that felt oddly quiet and small. Glück herself presented no fewer contradictions. Though plainly-dressed, soft-spoken, and diminutive, Glück moved through the room with unseen force, parting the crowd with ease. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>We often treat works of art as self-contained aesthetic objects whose formal qualities give them meaning independent of the lives and intentions of their artists. Every time I attend a poetry reading, I find new reasons to doubt this critical approach and the lingering influence of New Criticism it represents. The strange contrasts of Louise Glück’s event reflect the uncanny way both poem and poet can transform at a reading&mdash;a space that puts the artist in intimate proximity to their art. Perhaps we <em>can </em>understand texts as self-contained aesthetic objects. But is that enough? </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Take “October,” the first poem Glück read. On its own, the poem is an exploration of the natural world as muse and tormenter&mdash;inspiring in its beauty, yet mocking in how it will survive us. “October” unfolds over 62 strophes. At the reading, as Glück worked her way through the poem, its length gave the words time to absorb the closeness and intimacy of her delivery. Glück herself even seemed to become part of the poem, her small presence shadowed by the oracular voice of the poem’s speaker. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Something similar happened when Glück read “A Foreshortened Journey”&mdash;a prose poem she said she wrote during a two-week attempt to best Kafka's short short stories. In the poem, the imagery of a children’s story turns into an allegory for mortality, as a grandmother and a child meet a man collapsed halfway up the stairs of his life. On the page, this poem is unsettling. But in Glück’s reading, the eerie presence of death was palpable, as if it had slipped out of the poem and settled somewhere just behind the poet’s body. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>I don’t think the idea that seeing poetry performed is a unique experience will shock many readers. But I do think this fact reveals something significant about how we draw the boundaries of a text. The New Critical approach may make sense when we limit a literary work to words on a page: After all, if at least some meaning does not live in the text alone, how could an uninformed reader still appreciate it? Yet a real and strikingly new version of the text seems to exist at the nexus of words, speech, and body that a live reading creates. And for interpreting this intense intrusion of the written word into reality, New Criticism offers no tools. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Thinking over this experience later that night, I was reminded of German critical theorist Walter Benjamin’s concept of the “aura” of a work of art. In “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” Benjamin argues that when technology made art reproducible, we lost a level of aesthetic experience&mdash;that is, the aura, the almost supernatural force that present and original art exerts on the viewer. But maybe this aura is not lost; maybe it exists in the alchemy that combines and transforms poem and poet into a new and larger work of art at readings. And maybe the reason we exclude this way of interacting with a text from our literary theory is because this aura is hard to come by in an age when Poetry Foundation makes the black-and-white letters of any poem available instantly and for free. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>None of this is to say that the digitization and dissemination of poetry is a problem. I think it’s a solution&mdash;one that has made art more available to more people than ever before. But I will remember this experience the next time I’m tempted to skip a reading because I could read the poetry online. After the reading, I approached Glück to get a book signed and found myself dumbstruck by this small, quiet, and unimposing character. Glück asked me how to spell my name and, for a second, I didn’t know. No webpage has ever made me feel that kind of awe. </p>",

		"slug" : "wedonotliveincairo",
		"body" : "<p><em></em><em>I am a son of Tahrir</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Born into hope, into heat, into thousands of voices</em></p>\r\n<p><em>I am a son of Tahrir, out in the crowd on the street</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Our pain, our pride, our choices</em></p>\r\n<p>&hellip;</p>\r\n<p><em>Tahrir is now</em></p>\r\n<p><em>And, now is here</em></p>\r\n<p><em>We’ll wait an hour, a day, a month, a year</em></p>\r\n<p><em>We have cracked the wall of fear</em></p>\r\n<p><em>We’ll see it crumble</em></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>“Tahrir Is Now,” a song from the musical “We Live in Cairo,” was playing in the background as I read the news about the controversy over the local elections in Turkey. The ruling party, which has been in power for 17 years now, lost the municipal elections to the opposition in Istanbul. However, the newspaper wrote, the ruling party was refusing to accept the election results, alleging that there had been fraud. “Do <em>our choices </em>really matter?” I asked myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>\r\n<p>“No,” the state replied, as it overturned the election results after a few weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>\r\n<p>I was disappointed and frustrated. Then, I heard the Lazour brothers, creators of the musical, which is currently in production at the American Repertory Theatre, sing “Tahrir Is Now.” In this song, I heard the refrain: “Yes, your choices matter.” </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>I have never been to Tahrir, a square in Cairo known as the location of the 2011 political demonstrations. I do not speak Arabic. In fact, I did not even know “Tahrir” meant “freedom” until I enthusiastically played the song for a music-savvy friend of mine who happened to speak the language. How, I wondered, can a song whose title I do not even understand mean so much to me? Why was I so excited to see the production of “We Live in Cairo?”</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>This musical is written by Daniel and Patrick Lazour, brothers and collaborators of Lebanese descent. Its plot follows the story of six students as they fight to bring down the regime of President Hosni Mubarak on the streets of Cairo through various means: Hany and Amir write protest songs while Karim and Hassan paint murals; Layla takes photographs at the protests that Fadwa organizes. Inspired by the actual young Egyptians who took over Tahrir Square in 2011, the musical tells a fictional story rooted in reality.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>This reality was that 846 protesters were killed and 6000 more were injured by the police during the 18 days of protests in Tahrir Square, protests that nevertheless persisted under the slogan “Bread, Freedom and Social Justice,” fuelled by the hope for a better economic and political system. It was the reality behind its story that rendered “We Live in Cairo” particularly moving for me. I could not dismiss it as a yet another art piece that romanticizes activism; it was real, and I felt empowered. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><em>As someone from Turkey... –– </em>I found myself prefacing every opinion I expressed about the show with this phrase. It felt right to me and nobody else questioned it, but I could not pin down what about my Turkish identity served to connect me so directly to the Egypt of 2011 represented onstage &mdash; especially given that Egyptian culture actually shared relatively few commonalities with my own. But when I talked to Sharif Afifi, who plays Karim in “We Live In Cairo,” his words clarified the link. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Although it is never explicitly vocalized in the play, Karim is a gay man. I asked Sharif if he felt the need to talk to gay men in Egypt while building his character. He explained that the danger of being openly queer in Egypt made this endeavor impossible, but that he was able to draw upon his personal experiences as an openly gay Anglo-Egyptian. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>“As much as the details of suppression and oppression are specific to a country,” he added, “there is something universal in that feeling of imprisonment of self.” </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>There was my answer. The number of people who were killed and injured during the 2013 protests against the government in Istanbul was different than in Cairo, but violence is the same. The number of journalists imprisoned in Turkey for speaking up was different than in Egypt, but censorship is the same. The deep-seated fear that unconsciously lowers your voice while talking about politics in public is the same. The need to cover your face with a scarf against tear gas before going out to protest is the same. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>If the imprisonment of self could be universal across national borders, perhaps so could the imprisonment of ideas and ideals.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Dana Saleh Omar, who plays Fadwa in the musical, told me that she has been searching for something like “We Live in Cairo” for her entire life. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>“‘Why aren’t there stories about me and where I come from?’ I kept asking myself,” she told me over the phone the day after I saw the show. Dana is not from Egypt; her parents are Jordanian-Palestinian immigrants. Yet she feels that “We Live in Cairo” is still her story. As it is my story, and the story of Taibi Magar, the show’s Egyptian-American director, and of Samar Haddad King, its choreographer based in Palestine and New York City, and certainly that of its Lebanese-American writers. As it is for all those living under authoritarian regimes. Regardless of our hometown, we, as people with ties to countries suffering political oppression, have come to own the story “We Live in Cairo” tells.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>During our conversation, Sharif pointed out how uncommon it was for people with Middle Eastern heritage to be given the opportunity to tell their stories through theatre. We see stories from Chicago, from Paris and even from the Scotland of the 17th century, but it is rare to see a story from Egypt on stage. It is even rarer, I thought, to find a musical produced by a creative team entirely made up of artists with Middle Eastern roots. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>The team’s familiarity with the culture of the region manifested itself in the production down to its smallest details. Before the musical began, a plastic chair greeted the audience from the empty Loeb Main Stage. The chair was absurdly red and absurdly bright. It reminded me of all the unimportant items I saw in the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul. All these cheap plastic objects came in ostentatious hues as if their colors could reclaim their significance. The chair appeared out of place in front of the dark gray wall where it was standing, but its brightness was unapologetic. Its red was beautifully disruptive. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Once the show started, the chair got lost in the array of bright colors. Rugs and cushions of every tint covered the surface of the stage; the décor alone could lift spirits. Soon, all these glowing items were pushed to the side, and the audience was left with a dark stage and a high wall that dwarfed the actors. The wall was not like the chair; its color was dull. It did not disappear like the chair did; it stood still while everything else slowly fell apart. When the red chair reappeared on stage, the play had covered not only the Tahrir Square Uprising, but also the election of Mohamed Morsi, former president of Egypt, and his resignation a year later. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>I wondered how the performers tasked with embodying the experience of revolutionaries could internalize two years of political turmoil that is not only complicated but also violent. Both Dana and Sharif told me about the timeline of the events in Cairo posted on the wall of their rehearsal room, supplemented by a collection of reference books. Sharif noted that the first few weeks of rehearsal were “an intense learning process, as [the actors] were being fed with the details of the events.” Dana recalled one of these details as particularly difficult to digest: the death of Khaled Saeed. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Khaled Saeed was a young Egyptian who was beaten to death by the police, though the police &nbsp;claimed that Saeed had died of asphyxiation as he attempted to swallow a packet of hashish. However, a photo Saeed’s brother took of his body in the morgue went viral online, helping to incite the 2011 uprisings. During the rehearsals, Dana said, the actors were asked to look at this photo of Khaled Saeed’s disfigured corpse. After our conversation, I could not help but google the photo. Before interviewing Dana, I had already known Saeed’s story, but looking at his damaged face, I felt as if someone had punched me in the stomach. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>I had likewise known the history of the Egyptian Revolution before seeing “We Live in Cairo.” Yet there was something powerfully inspiring about watching the musical retell this story and something deeply touching about hearing the notes of “Tahrir Is Now.” I cannot identify that <em>something</em>, but I can tell you that “We Live in Cairo” is about that thing. It is about what made Egyptians in 2011 go outside and fight for justice after hearing melodies like Amir’s and lyrics like Hany’s. It is about what made them build tents in Tahrir Square and wait for freedom for 18 days, after seeing paintings like Karim’s and photos like Layla’s. “We Live in Cairo” is about the thing that photos, songs, and paintings ignite in us and the change they fuel; in Egypt, in Istanbul and in all the other lands of oppression. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<figure></figure>\r\n<figure><img data-image=\"\"></figure>",

		"slug" : "bostoncalling2019",
		"body" : "<p>Electric Forest takes place in a woodland of thousands of years old. Bonnaroo features craftsmen and artisans vending their wares. Coachella is... Coachella. Aspiring to some bohemian or rustic ideal (whether achieved or not), each of these events has its idiosyncratic personality. But Boston Calling is the corporate-sponsored, licensed-to-within-an-inch-of-its-life, capitalist cousin of these festivals. It’s as if it was designed in a boardroom at McKinsey&mdash;at the 2019 edition of Boston Calling, everything ran smoothly, but after the music ended, the revelers departed without a single distinctive memory of the festival organization itself.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, Boston Calling gets its music right. This year’s cast was studded in gold&mdash;the lineup included indie sweethearts Mitski and Tame Impala; hip-hop superstars Travis Scott and Anderson .Paak; the likes of Odesza and King Princess to fill out the in-between; EDM crowd-pleasers like Mura Masa, house music wonder-girl Yaeji&hellip; the list goes on. With only a few missteps (looking at you, Twenty One Pilots) the organizers ensured that at pretty much any given moment, there was someone worth seeing, making the festival worthwhile for music lovers of nearly every variety. They even took the probably unnecessary yet thoughtful step of including performances by the Boston Ballet and several stand-up comedians. Advo writers Sean and Jovi took in the sights and sounds of the well-curated weekend. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>DAY 1: <em>First Impressions</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Sean:</strong> The Festival kicked off Friday, May 24th, which of the three days was the least crowded but perhaps the most diverse in the genres it included and the age groups they attracted. There were twenty-somethings at Mura Masa, thirty-somethings at Lord Huron, and forty-somethings chaperoning their ten-somethings at Twenty One Pilots. My first show was Mura Masa, who brought a fantastic energy to his set and, unlike what seems to be typical of most DJs these days, even played a few instruments. After that, I undertook the twenty-second hike to the directly adjacent stage to watch Lord Huron, who looked exactly like the hipsterish outdoorsy-adjacent man I pictured him to be, expensive cowboy hat and all. His was a set of the “good vibes” variety and one of the few where it felt kosher to roll out a blanket and sit down.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Jovi</strong>: Meanwhile, on the largest Green Stage, Christine and the Queens were such a treat to watch. Chris and her incredibly well-practiced crew of dancers managed to fill the performance with their movement and their presence. The occasional pyro was well timed, the spectacle was impeccably rehearsed. In her softer moments, Chris made the occasional French-accented joke, and the audience was with her all the way. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Just after this performance, at the adjacent Red Stage, Greta Van Fleet prepped to go on. I am not, in general, a huge fan of 20-somethings who borrow the classic rock aesthetic of the ‘70s. Greta Van Fleet’s spirited but ultimately uninspired performance reminded me exactly why I am so put off by this brand of mic-shrieking. At his best, lead vocalist Joshua Kiszka can, admittedly, command a crowd with his voice. Yet his best is often buried underneath cringe-worthy lyrics and kitschy melodies that imitate the retro feel of arena rock heroes but contain none of their grit. The crowd around me consisted mainly of older white guys, beer in hand, who have probably all seen better days. Mid-performance, one of them yelled to no one in particular: “Yes! This is real music! Fuck soundcloud rappers! This is real rock-and-roll!” then stumbled up to another guy to congratulate him for his faded Led Zeppelin t-shirt. But of course, Greta Van Fleet is not Led Zeppelin. While the band might adopt the cosmetics of classic rock icons, their repetitive shrieking lacks any of the creativity that makes the greats great. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Sean:</strong> Chvrches played later that evening on the Delta Stage, and though they underwhelmed somewhat in my opinion, the crowd was enthused, throwing glow-sticks up like batons and synchronizing handclaps during the choruses. The lead singer supplied the usual gush about how much they loved playing in Boston, and then “Clearest Blue” came on, a revelatory song that had even the Boston sports bros pushing their way to the front to dance out their demons. If you don’t know the song, I would advise putting in your headphones and blasting it immediately.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Toward the end of Chvrches’ set, Twenty One Pilots started on the main stage, which was my cue to get as far away from there as possible. In a festival-saving move, the organizers had scheduled the brilliant Yaeji to play at the same time in the hockey arena, sparing many of us from having to listen to “Blurryface” one more time. Yaeji sang her classic vocals, like whispers turned up to max volume, creating a magnetic effect. She also had an unexpected and infectious energy for a house DJ&mdash;I don’t think I saw her stop smiling once. Though the perimeter lights killed the dark anonymity in which club music tends to thrive, it didn’t matter; by the end of her set, Yaeji had turned the entire crowd into believers.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Jovi: </strong>Twenty One Pilots. This addition to the lineup was a confusing one. Perhaps it was a money-grabbing move to cater to the angsty pre-teen crowd, a decision which might have been acceptable if the music lived up to the hype. Unfortunately, the reality was more noise than finesse. Yes, it was pretty cool that they had a burning car on stage for most of the act. No, this stunt could not make up for the over-loudness that sounded even worse as I made my disappointed way back home across the river.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>DAY 2: <em>The Peak </em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Sean: </strong>Saturday was a perfect day, with perfect weather, by far the most stacked lineup, and the biggest crowd. I kicked off the day with Superorganism, a band who&mdash;and I mean this without sarcasm&mdash;is the very definition of good vibes. With what seemed like twenty young twenty-year-olds onstage (three of them simply hit tambourines with ribbons attached to them), the act gave an impression of ceaseless moving and bouncing, bringing the crowd along in pursuit of a good time. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Mitski, the critically-acclaimed album-of-the-year darling, came on right after. In my mind Mitski is a true “artiste,” conducting herself with poise and a seriousness that belies her relative youth. Her only props were a white chair and table, but that was all she needed to impress.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Jovi: </strong>Mitski was a powerhouse. Our best American girl pranced energetically around a stage with nothing but a table and chair on it, exuding both sex appeal and rebellious energy. Between bouts of energetic prancing, she sometimes struggled to sustain her vocals&mdash;but Mitski was with her audience the whole time, almost staring them down. She even played “First Love / Late Spring”!! So good!! </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Sean:</strong> I then made my way over to the polar opposite of Mitski: Denzel Curry. He was, for lack of a better phrase, dumb lit. Yeet. He does one thing and does it very well: mosh pits. Denzel’s singular goal seems to be to get drunk people to throw their limbs at one another while roaring his raps at the top of their lungs. An endless supply of crushed beer cans and testosterone filled the air as Denzel shouted, “I wanna see y’all motherfuckers go crazy&mdash;make a big circle&hellip; no, that’s not big enough&hellip; my fucking god, y’all know what a circle is? Okay, that’s fine, you’re fine; now get ready. Okay, 3, 2, 1... NOW, MOSH,” before flinging himself off the stage into the crowd. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Jovi:</strong> King Princess was charismatic as hell. Her crooning voice on “1950” sounded just like the track&mdash;vulnerable, yearning. Sporting a classic nonchalant slouch and a snapback, Mikaela Straus is the lesbian streetwear icon we never knew we needed. As I pushed to the front of the crowd, I began to appreciate just how many pre-20s white lesbians are her die-hard fans. And why not? Sustained, whispy vocals and the occasional guitar riff&mdash;King Princess was talent. As proof of her charisma, fanatics’ bras flew toward the stage while she sang.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Sean:</strong> I started King Princess's set standing at the back, mostly unaware of who she was, and came out following her profile on Spotify.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Anderson .Paak & The Free Nationals were up next, and they got the crowd feeling funky fresh. I saw them once before at Sasquatch music festival, and though I thought he was perhaps a bit more energetic there, that was nothing compared to what happened during his set at Boston Calling. Halfway through his performance, they brought out Lil Nas X to perform “Old Town Road,” and the festival lost it. In a sparkled-up, black-and-white cowboy outfit, Lil Nas X had the crowd screaming in ecstasy. Millions of Instagram stories memorialized the moment. I saw Odesza next, which the organizers put at the same time as Hozier, as if love of EDM and soul music are mutually exclusive. But too many good artists is a good problem to have.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Jovi:</strong> Meanwhile, Hozier was unimpressive&mdash;he’s got a great voice and when it lands, the effect is chilling. Yet the majority of his performance was subdued&mdash;and there are only so many times you can watch a guy wail longingly into the mic. More importantly, it seemed as if the crowd was just waiting for the fella to play “Take Me To Church” before they felt okay leaving. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Sean:</strong> Tame Impala was a spectacular closing act. No one else’s visual effects came close&mdash;their display coupled with their sound was a psychedelic bliss. The following bits I overheard in the crowd say it all:</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>“Dude, bro, I would literally marry anyone who asked me to right now.”</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>“Should I take another tab right now? I think I might!”</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>“He looks like Jesus. Is he Jesus?”</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>After they finished their set, a lightning storm kicked up, sending the buckets of confetti that littered the ground twirling into the sky. Watching those pieces of paper tumble and disappear from view, only to be lit up again by the next bolt, was one of those serendipitous moments that can only happen at a music festival.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>DAY 3: <em>Finale </em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Sean:</strong> With its lineup heavy on rappers, the final day of the festival attracted the older high school crowd&mdash;the type that knows every word to “Sicko Mode” and wears high cut Adidas socks and Supreme t-shirts&mdash;and with it, an especially potent smell of weed. I started off my day with Rainbow Kitten Surprise&mdash;a blast, complete with a dancing crowd and energetic insertions of rocking guitar licks into almost every song. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><strong>Jovi: </strong>Here’s a hot tip. If you get a little bit (very) blazed and lie down on the artificial turf facing Delta stage, the energy from RKS actually seeps through the floor and into your body. The mellow evening sun caresses you with its warmth. The reverb cradles you from the ground up. When you finally decide it’s time to see what’s on stage: a mix of psychedelic color. RKS doesn’t let you rest&mdash;song after song, lick after lick. You’re just happy to be there, a part of the sound. </p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Sean: </strong>Sheck Wes, by contrast with RKS, was a disappointment. While his visuals complimented the understated gravity of his lyrics (for instance, he projected mugshots of people from his home neighborhood), his sound consisted largely of yelling into the mic without variation, which quickly grew tiring. Besides during “Mo Bamba,” no one moved to his beats.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Next was Logic, whom I’ve come to think of as the favorite artist of people who equate fast rapping with good rapping. He was similarly milquetoast in person. “I represent one thing &mdash; what is that thing? Peace, love and positivity,” he announced. Never mind that those are three things.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>I left soon after to see Brandi Carlile, a Grammy-nominated folk singer with the voice of an angel. Her style of music isn’t for everyone, but her technical competence and ability to connect with the crowd were obvious. She made the wise decision to pare down the visuals and props and focus solely on her sound. At times, she explained the stories behind her songs, revealing details about her life and her struggles as a mother who is a part of the LGBT+ community. In conclusion, we stan.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travis Scott closed the night and the festival, leaving me with mixed feelings. On the one hand, the beats and music were fire, but on the other, it was basically just Travis screaming every fifth word over a vocal track which remained virtually unchanged from the recordings. However, when he finally did drop the backing track of himself and sung the words to “Love Galore,” with surprisingly creative autotuning, I found myself swaying along with everyone else.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>ALL IN ALL?</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> </span>Boston Calling is like the gentrified juice bar that’s recently moved into town yet you’re not super angry about because it tastes just so damn good. There were a lot of highs and lows this year, with one or two boring headliners and more than a few transcendent underdogs. Fortunately, the emphasis was on the latter, and for all their corporate sponsorships, the organizers still know how to pick a good lineup. And in the end, that’s all that really matters. Everyone from the tatted drunk hipster to the soon-to-be influencer teenager to the old parent seemed to be enjoying themselves in the summer sun. Boston was calling and it was a pleasure to answer.</p>",

		"body" : "<p>On a summertime Tuesday night, the Brooklyn queer bar 3 Dollar Bill readied itself to host an unlikely trinity. I wandered in among the ticketholders who were congregating, apparently undaunted by the impending weekday morning, for a performance of <em>Oscar at the Crown</em>. The website announcing this “immersive nightclub phenomenon” promised a show that would situate in one dystopian future the three pillars of society: sequins, Oscar Wilde, and the housewives of Orange County.&nbsp;<br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>A lot to prepare for, perhaps, so the musical’s site also offered some advice: “Wear something cool!” The wardrobes of the audience had clearly obliged. The primary colors dutifully coalesced in a corner over a round of drinks: bright red jumpsuit on one attendee, on another, a bluish sleeveless two-piece number complete with buttons and lapels, and on a third, a canary tee proclaiming, “I’m a limited luxury edition of myself.” An iPhone glowed through the pocket in a pair of pinstriped linen sailor pants descending from red suspenders. Above an ensemble of distressed tartan overalls and a Christmas-toned sweater, and beneath a head of perfectly coiffed pink-tipped hair, I thought I recognized a face.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>If I was right, this was Andrew Barret Cox, the choreographer and composer of <em>Oscar at the Crown</em>. Part dance party, part musical-within-a-musical, the show was put on at 3 Dollar Bill by The Neon Coven. This performance collective, co-founded with Cox by director Shira Milikowsky and Mark Mauriello, creator of the earliest version of <em>Oscar</em>, proclaims its particular affection for three things (separated by emojis for emphasis): “queer people,” “theater in nontraditional spaces,” and “screaming.”&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>A door opened in the far wall of the bar area, letting the audience into the nontraditional theater space of the trio’s dreams. The room was transformed according to the script into a nightclub-turned-bunker dubbed “The Crown.” When I entered, an EDM beat was already pulsing through the space, and three dancers, raised above the audience on a wheeled platform in the center of the room and on the edges of a stage, were channelling that pulse with virtuosity into hip-hop moves and some frankly sick voguing. Yet another unexpected trifecta came together in one dancer’s getup, which miraculously combined the aesthetic elements of roller derby, the U.S. army, and BDSM.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Milikowsky explained to me on the phone after I’d seen the show that this venue had revealed itself to her in much the same way it did to me that night &mdash; “like Narnia.” The Neon Coven had booked the front of this bar last year for a rock concert that set the tone for the collective’s work. The concert had featured, for instance, Mauriello’s performance of a punkified take on “Sweet Transvestite” from Cox’s adaptation of the camp classic <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em>, as well as sneak-peek numbers from <em>Oscar</em>. During the sound-check, Mauriello had opened a door in the back to reveal the ideal space for <em>Oscar at the Crown</em>. Here, the constraints of reality need not apply: the show was free to dispense with the pedantry of believability and draw in the audience by other means.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>But at the start of the performance, though like many travelling clusters of audience members I was dancing along to the EDM in the direction of better vantage points to get a look at the dancers, I was not yet in tune with the musical’s methods. When the actors claimed the stage and a spirited opening number soared over the audience, I was immediately in conscientious reviewer mode. After all, my promise to cover the show (made in a press inquiry sent, as directed by the Coven’s website, to the address <a href=\"mailto:heygorgeous@gmail.com\">hey.gorgeous@oscaratthecrown.com</a>&nbsp;&mdash; aw, thanks, you too!), seemed to me then to presuppose my ability to follow the details of the plot. I stopped dancing and strained to hear the lyrics from which to build the requisite informed opinion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>The first blow to the pious theater-goer in me came in the form of the show’s “three rules,” proclaimed by the actors after the opening song with a gusto that put standard exit-sign tours to shame. “Please be aware that the events reflected in tonight’s performance are closer than they appear,” one announced. Another told us, “Move around <em>anywhere you want&nbsp;</em>&mdash; any time, all night,” including, as the first voice chimed in, the bar and the bathroom. And finally, regarding phones: “Do whatever the fuck you want with them.”</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>As the show went on and the sea of spectators swiveled and parted every which way to accommodate the dance of wheeled platforms acting as exuberantly mobile extensions of the stage, I eventually pieced together an understanding of the musical's premise (which I confess I later filled in with the help of the written script). Exiles from a dystopian society &mdash; the emergence of which had been predicted by none other than Julie Cooper of <em>The OC, </em>the precursor show to <em>The Real Housewives of Orange County&nbsp;</em>&mdash; were residing in a bunker fashioned from a nightclub known as The Crown, and had chosen the Orange County’s housewives and Oscar Wilde as objects of reverence. The latter’s life and love affair with a younger man named Bosie served as the storyline for the sparkle-studded performance that the exiles repeated as their main pastime and were now presenting for a dazed newcomer, a recent reject of the world outside. The leader of the exiles played Oscar, and cast the newcomer as Constance Wilde, Oscar’s wife. But this situation was not easy to ascertain. Explanatory details got lost in the mixture of backing track volume, powerful vocals calling from the stage, and the cheering and stomping of the audience response.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>This mode of enthusiasm was entirely justified: the songs were expertly arranged and executed to bear the audience along on the show’s wave of club party energy. The musical jovially rebelled against the role of attentive viewer in which traditional theater casts its attendees. Achieved through its format and all but stated in its three “rules,” the show’s goal seemed to be the liberation and inclusion of the audience. Glitter-clad, angel-voiced, and expertly harmonizing, the actors turned us from passive consumers into ecstatic co-conspirators. I quickly reconsidered my journalistic practices and joined the dancing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>For the most part, <em>Oscar At The Crown</em> stays true to its quotation from the real Wilde’s work: “Life is far too important a thing to ever talk seriously about.” Style and drive supersede the facts of the matter &mdash; the finer points of the plot are unflinchingly sacrificed for the momentum of the show, at least for most of its duration. After a bout of booms and crashes outside the exiles’ shelter subsides, the musical’s Oscar decides to “skip the trial scene and go right to the finale.” As an introduction to his rapid-fire summary of the legal proceedings that ended in the actual Wilde’s imprisonment and that I don’t pretend to have followed too closely, anxious as I and the protagonist both were for the next ecstatic song, the show’s Oscar tells us, “Here’s what you need to know, and it’s not important.” As soon as he’s done talking, the music revs right back up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>The musical’s eventual divergence from exile-Oscar’s (and arguably the real Wilde’s) philosophy came as a shock. As Milikowsky described it to me when I talked to her and Mauriello after seeing the show, “it’s a party, it’s a party, it’s a party &mdash; until it’s not.” This “rise, crash” trajectory has been central to the musical since its inception as Mauriello’s undergraduate thesis at Harvard, perhaps because, as Milikowsky pointed out, such an arc parallels the plotline of Oscar Wilde’s actual life. Mauriello explained that near the end of the musical came a moment to “pull the rug up” from under the audience so that we would pay attention.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Following the finale of the show within the show, I heard the music cut out completely for the first time since I had entered The Crown. It was like being plunged underwater or having the wind knocked out of me &mdash; landing hard on my tailbone, maybe, once the carpet had been pulled out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>“That’s the finale? That’s the ending?” asked with incredulity the newest exile, who had just witnessed the end of the play-within-the-play. This line I could hear perfectly. She proceeded to claim center stage in order to speak up on behalf of Constance Wilde, and condemn her husband’s wrongdoings. The musical’s Oscar grew angry and the rest, including the audience, stood in stony silence. “You can’t just tell the good parts of the story and we can’t just keep telling the same version over and over and over,” exile-turned-Constance argued. Good point, I thought, wishing for the music back. I’ll write that the show was a fantastic time until the end.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Admittedly, the heavy-handedness of the speech left me reeling. But anything more subtle would have gotten lost among the echoes of the throbbing EDM and the full bar’s offerings still ricocheting in the minds of the audience. After a conciliatory song and Oscar’s acquiescence, the ensuing “Megamix” of the musical’s songs plunged me straight back into the dance party I’d entered at the start, but Constance Wilde stuck fast in my thoughts. “Ultimately, what the character of Constance argues for is a multiplicity of voices,” Mauriello explained to me in our interview. That proliferation necessitates a disruption &mdash; a feminist rant does the trick, and perhaps little else would.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>The creative team’s concern for multiplicity manifested itself with nuance in the show’s casting; the night I attended provided a special example of the dilemmas involved. Mauriello was out sick, so Oscar was played by the understudy, a woman named Zofia Weretka. Milikowsky explained to me that Weretka “has a presence similar to [Mauriello’s], despite their being different genders,” making her the best candidate for the role. However, the switch meant that the relationship between Oscar and Bosie, portrayed by a male-identifying and -presenting actor, could be read as heterosexual.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>The standard hazards of live performance as they play out in <em>Oscar</em> illuminate the complexity of its creators’ ambition, which consists in staying true to a story where gender is crucial while rejecting the binary’s limitations on casting. While the initial plan was to preserve the gayness of the couple by having a female actor play Bosie when the understudy went on for Oscar, the directors ultimately opted not to replace Bosie, wary of the dangers of putting in two understudies in leading roles at the same time. But then, according to Milikowsky, “pretty much the entire cast is gender fluid and gender open,” and the central couple’s costumes contributed to non-binary forms of gender expression that ran counter to an interpretation of the couple as traditionally heterosexual.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Nonetheless, Milikowsky is far from dismissive of the unresolved issues of gender fluidity in casting and performance &mdash; related questions have long preoccupied her, both puzzling and inspiring. “Do you ask people pronouns when they audition? Do you not? Which one’s more respectful? Which one’s limiting? &hellip; When you’re casting someone, are you casting them on how they identify or are you casting them on how they present?” she, along with many of her colleagues in off-Broadway theater, continue to ask. “We don’t have answers. It’s very exciting.”&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>The unifying factor behind the show’s eclectic collection of subjects suggests that the performativity crucial to gender expression can extend to one’s entire outward-facing self. “To say it the most simply,” Mauriello told me in response to my puzzlement over the renowned writer's connection to&nbsp;housewife-themed reality TV, “Oscar Wilde would have been fucking incredible on Twitter.” Mauriello expresses his fascination with the few people like Wilde who, before the amplification tools of the Internet, were able to “create something of themselves that is larger than themselves” and embody the maxim, “‘My identity is a performance.’” He went on to explain, “Oscar Wilde himself wrote that Jesus Christ was the first person to do this.” After Jesus and Oscar, the venerable lineage of larger-than-life performers of identity continued with “Prince and David Bowie and Madonna and Judy Garland and Marilyn Monroe.” Mauriello rattled off the list in one breath.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>And why not? I buy it. The Real Housewives of Orange County are nothing if not an extreme example of this process, offering up their entire lives to public image creation.&nbsp;Mauriello added that with the advent of social media, “every single person now has the power to craft that iconic version of themselves.”</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>The musical was stylized and exaggerated just as an individual would have to do to their persona to transform into an icon &mdash; starting with the original religious meaning of the word, and through to the extended definition that applies to the Real Housewives. Though the lyrics that might have clarified this were the hardest to hear, enveloping the audience in the relevant aesthetic was probably the surest way to get this point across. And it was certainly a pleasure to be enveloped in the indefatigable energy that permeated&nbsp;<em>Oscar at the Crown</em>.&nbsp;</p>",

It’s a green, suburban walk to the station and I see a lot of deer. I also get a lot of catcalls. Google Maps says it takes 23 minutes, but the ETA algorithm does not take into account catcall-induced acceleration. I can do it in 15. In order to get to work on time, I must quell the instinct to run up to the offenders and shake my fist. Here are the pieces of my mind I never ended up giving them.&nbsp;</i></p><p><br></p>\r\n<p><i>June 25, 2019 at 9:14 p.m. New Hampshire Ave. NE&nbsp;</i></p>\r\n<p>Lingered a little too long at the park near the Fort Totten Metro station observing a family of deer, and now it's dark out. We all know that the Honda Civic, particularly one of the mid-2000s variety, is fundamentally a sexless family vehicle. If the deer mama drove a car, she would drive a Honda Civic, and she would take the baby deer to soccer practice and yell at the baby deer on the way to the dentist for not flossing every day. In recent years, they have tried fruitlessly to increase the erotic appeal of the Honda Civic by introducing colors like \"Burgundy Night Pearl\" and \"Modern Steel Metallic.\" Apparently, Honda Civics make up for their lackluster hue offerings with their energy efficiency. I never knew environmentalism and misogyny could coexist so happily. Not that the sex appeal of good fuel economy is lost on me &mdash; Prius? Fine. Chevy Volt? Great. Tesla? In a heartbeat &mdash; but I would honestly never fuck anyone who drives a Honda Civic.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\r\n<p><i>June 28, 2019 </i><i>at 7:44 p.m. 1st Ave. NE&nbsp;</i></p>\r\n<p>Suppose that someone is blasting the early-aughts banger “My Neck, My Back” while driving at 5 mph on a residential road, and the passenger sitting shotgun sticks his head out the window. He makes eye contact with you before doing the up-and-down; your body feels gelatinous and transparent. The streets are narrow enough that he could touch you if he wanted. The last time you listened to this song was through an embedded YouTube link in the NPR Music feature “The 200 Greatest Songs by 21st Century Women+.” When the car squeaks by, you imagine him sticking his hand out and reaching inside you. Now is not the time to be thinking about this situation in terms of its standup potential but there’s something funny about the possibility of being assaulted to the tune of a song about female pleasure. You could do a bit about it. About how he totally mishears the song. It’s true that some songs are kind of hard to understand. Like how in Leona Lewis’s Bleeding Love, “you cut me open and I” sounds like “you call me your banana.” Or how in Taylor Swift’s Blank Space, “long list of ex-lovers” sounds like “lonely Starbucks lovers.” In Elton John’s Tiny Dancer “hold me closer tiny dancer” sounds like “hold me closer Tony Danza.” Or like how in Khia’s My Neck, My Back, “make sure I keep busting nuts” sounds like &mdash;&nbsp;should this be an actual pun, or should it be a total non-sequitur? It could be funny if it were a complete non-sequitur. Ignorant people are always funny, people who focus on the wrong things because they have blinders on are always funny. The car moves past, and he turns his head to continue staring. This is not a catcall; he didn’t say a word. What are other songs it would be funny to be catcalled to? No Scrubs by TLC.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\r\n<p><i>July 1, 2019</i><i> at 7:58 a.m. New Hampshire Ave. NE&nbsp;</i></p>\r\n<p>And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\r\n<p><i>July 3, 2019 at 8:52 a.m. New Hampshire Ave. NE and S.

Now that the walk’s been cut out of my trip, the only voices I’m gonna be hearing on my way to and from the Fort Totten Metro station are “Stop Requested” and “1st Place NE and Ingraham.” Gotta say, the automated voice of the bus announcer is actually pretty seductive.&nbsp;</p>",

		"slug" : "WithBatshevaInParis",
		"body" : "<p>The day after the hottest day ever recorded in Paris (42 degrees Celsius, 108 degrees Fahrenheit), two things happen. One: Batsheva’s Young Ensemble&mdash;the training appendage of the modern dance group Batsheva Dance Company&mdash;puts on its final show for the<em> Festival Paris l’Été</em>, performing the 2000 piece <em>Decadance. </em>Two: the heat breaks&mdash;just gives way&mdash;and is forgotten. The cold lands in its place. Leaves fall, as if in autumn.<br></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>These two things happen at the same time. They are unrelated. The cold did not come for Batsheva. It is there for them nonetheless. That explains the sweater I pull on&mdash;layering, the first time this summer&mdash;before walking the six blocks from my apartment to the theatre. Explains, too, the see-through rain-coats that volunteers hand out at the door. <em>Your call. But it’s going to rain, </em>one insists, after I decline.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It’s not quite a theatre, this place. The Collège-lycée Jacques Decour, the space for tonight’s show, is, actually, a high school. But it’s a French one and an old one, meaning it’s both beautiful and excessive, sprawling out cream-coloured courtyards bracketed with slim honey locusts. It’s in the hollow of one of these courtyards&mdash;out in the open air&mdash;where the Young Ensemble will perform. Hence the talk of the rain.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The first time I saw <em>Decadance,</em> there was no need for this kind of talk. That was years ago. It was winter. To see the show<em>, </em>I entered, unbuttoned my coat, coughed snow off my boots. The cold fell far away. Far&mdash;like a foreign language I spoke once, but could now only grasp the shape of. Inside, the theatre looked how theatres look: cushioned and quiet, ceilinged and floored. Its own little ecosystem, siphoned off from the world. There was no need to think&mdash;much less talk&mdash;of the winter waiting, white and endless, outdoors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In Paris now, I find a seat and pull my sweater around me. <em>Decadance</em>, I read from the programme, <em>is built of excerpts from over two decades of the choreographic work of Ohad Naharin, the artistic director of Batsheva from 1990 to 2018.</em>&nbsp; Naharin describes the piece as “quoting” sections from different works, so as to “create a whole new story.”</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This concept is the same as it was the last time. But, despite this sameness, there’s something different about seeing <em>Decadance</em> now. And it’s not, I think, just the fact that a few years have passed. Or that, because the Young Ensemble offers a residency for a maximum of two years, all the dancers tonight have different faces than the ones I first saw.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It’s something about the cold and the fact that I can feel it. About the dark on me, too, and the rain as well, the first drops of rain that come through the square of sky. When I first saw <em>Decadance, </em>the whole affair seemed introverted and inward-facing. Movement as movement. The show was arresting, yes, but seemed to refer to nothing outside of itself. Now though&mdash;hearing engines from the street, wearing the wet of July&mdash;<em>Decadance</em> feels tied to an external life. To the city. To the six blocks I walked to get here. It’s this world, I think, that <em>Decadance </em>wants for us to attend to and&mdash;perhaps most importantly&mdash;wants, more than anything, for itself to join.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I should say that when I first saw <em>Decadance</em> I had never seen Batsheva before. I had only a loose sense of what the company was, an even looser sense of the name Naharin. A boy I liked at the time&mdash;he was a dancer&mdash;told me about them, messaged me on Facebook with a link, and said <em>batsheva is from Israel and they are world renowned / they are the best in the world for contemporary / this is the show to see / you will walk away a new person. /</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>He was right about most of that. Batsheva is from Israel (based in Tel Aviv). They are also world renowned. Naharin received international attention in 2015 with <em>Mr. Gaga</em>, a documentary made about his life and his work. About Gaga, too&mdash;the movement language developed by Naharin and practiced regularly by Batsheva. The elevator pitch for Gaga goes something like this: a teacher, centred in the studio with dancers around them, offering guiding phrases. <em>Feel the collapse between your ears</em>. Dancers are encouraged to listen to their bodies and respond freely as they see fit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Of course, <em>Decadance </em>is not a Gaga class. Most of the show tonight is previously choreographed&mdash;meticulously so. Understanding the improvisatory instinct of Gaga, though, is important for grasping the freewheeling energy of the thing, as each movement seems to occur to a dancer at the precise moment at which their body brings it into being.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Not long after <em>Decadance </em>begins, dancers stage an excerpt from the 2001 piece <em>Naharin’s Virus. </em>Pressed up in a line towards the edge of the stage, they stand still as death, staring out through the front. Here in Paris, slow rain is coming down. Eyes sweating black, the dancers look out and break&mdash;one by one&mdash;from stillness.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A leg shoots out like a loose fish. A hip bone grinds itself into the floor. There’s a strong-jawed immediacy in these movements that refers&mdash;in a refracted, oblique way&mdash;to the way our bodies tend to make their way through the world. Most often instinctually, usually without thinking. A hand grabs a mouth, yanks it open to a smile. A young couple ducks out of the audience, into the foyer, away from the rain.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Later in the show, there’s a moment when the dancers duck out too, off the stage and into the sloped rows of our seats. Their eyes are still after us. Each one picks an audience member and takes them to the stage. Dean Martin’s “Sway” plays overhead. For a minute, the sight is an easy doppelganger for a wedding dance floor, suspended in the first moments after the DJ clicks over to a slow dance. Partners fumble together like weak magnets and then they’re with each other, leaning.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There’s a woman up there on stage. Her long grey hair is disciplined into carelessness and a smooth beige smock wraps loose around her. Sitting in front of me when I arrived, she was covering herself sourly with the raincoat given at the door. Now she’s up there and soft against her partner, doing little loops under her hips. She’s not telling her body what to do. Just moving&mdash;unrehearsed, together. It’s here that <em>Decadance’</em>s extension to a world outside the stage is perhaps at its most explicit. If it weren’t for the costumes, it’d be hard to tell the dancers from the rest.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As I look at the wide courtyard in which we sit, though, <em>Decadance</em>’s call to the present world seems to bristle against the oldness of this space. It’s true: the Lycée lets in the sounds and circumstances of life passing by outside its walls. But, despite this fact, each stone of the school still arrives from a past time, marks a certain history, and reiterates it up and around us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I’m thinking of what I’ve heard about this place. About the fact that, as a friend told me, scenes from Francois Truffaut’s film <em>The 400 Blows</em> were shot in next courtyard over. Or that before the Lycée was built, this land held some of the largest slaughterhouses in Paris. And how, on the hill just north of where we sit, the bishop Saint Denis was decapitated in 250 AD, only to calmly collect the head that was his, walk paces down the slope, die. (This last point was shared with me by a coworker one morning this summer, over coffee). In other words: something happened before now, something back before that, and, in Paris, people love to talk about it. It’s tricky to live&mdash;much less to dance&mdash;now, amongst all this history.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The first few weeks I was here, when I wasn’t bending down to read a plaque, I was craning up to make out a monument. After a day, I would come home to my flat. It was pitched high on the seventh floor of an old building, above two Turkish bakeries and an auto-repair shop. The seventh floor was also the top floor, so when you lay down on your back, all you could see, through the slanted windows, was the sky. The sky: hovering, like a flat disk of warm water, like an unchanged fact.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I spent hours like this. Lights low, stick of incense lit, ABBA over the Bluetooth. And me on my back. It was like a deprivation tank, one designed to evaporate the past, leave only the flat grey present here with me. In these moments, nothing felt quite as stark as the warm body that was mine in the room, my shoulder blade, hard, on the blue-tiled floor. Our bones, I’ve found, when we speak to them&mdash;have you noticed?&mdash;can answer only in the present tense.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I began taking breaks from pausing at plaques. I turned my head forward on my neck instead. At eye-level, a lot was happening upon this history. Trees were loosening up with summer. Beneath the trees, along the streets, was each person&mdash;all and each&mdash;passing by. There were men selling red-yellow cherries in the market. And there, across the way, children idled on the corner, drinking flavoured ice. I cannot tell you if history will think of them. I can tell you that, even if it will, it will think little of how they moved.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How they moved. The urbanist Jane Jacobs has talked about day-to-day movement as “the ballet of the city sidewalk.” And I get it. But what I saw seemed less like a ballet. Less rigor, less premeditation. There was a looseness, here, and a transience too. In the way one child poured the melted leftovers of his ice onto a friend’s shoes. Or how a shopkeeper gave a woman three baskets of cherries&mdash;no charge&mdash;that were left over at the end of the day. Beneath the city’s endless repetition of history, these simple gestures emerged. Happening, unrecorded, here.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Like <em>Decadance. </em>Like in the jittered ecstasy of the excerpt from <em>Three</em>, as dancers break off in their own rhythm, ripple in overlap, and back away again. They acknowledge each other, move with each other, turn inwards. All that emerges is what their bodies arrive at tonight. Performed tomorrow, things will change. The day after, change again. It’s in this way that <em>Decadance</em> comes unfixed from repetition, from the last time and the time before that, arriving before us just here, only tonight, under the sky.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Decadance </em>ends after an hour and a half. As it does, the Beach Boys’ “You’re Welcome” begins to play. The dark has come above and the rain has gone. I still don’t know if&mdash;as that boy promised, years ago&mdash;I am leaving <em>Decadance</em> now as a whole new person. But then the Young Ensemble arrives on stage. They’re facing out at us, arms extended, as if in anticipation of a hug. And, new person or not, I do know that I want to reach back to these other bodies, to embrace them. Stark and warm, here and now. <em>You’re welcome. / Well, you’re welcome to come.</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>People start to collect their things and the lights go up all the way, though it’s still dark in the cool night. The woman next to me is on her knees, looking for her purse. To me, though, she’s in movement. Feeling the collapse between her ears. Told we have been dancing, what do we do? Remember, perhaps.</p>",

		"body" : "<p>As I look for a comfortable viewing space within the crowd here to see YACHT’s performance at Rough Trade, I am surprised how packed the venue is. Since I discovered YACHT (“Young Americans Challenging High Technology”) in my early teens, the band’s renown has exploded. YACHT has gone from a little-known alternative favorite to a fairly known Grammy-nominated kombucha-drinking-crowd-drawing phenomenon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When I saw the band in January of 2018 in Manhattan on their “Strawberry Moon” tour, the small venue they performed in was maybe halfway full – I was never more than an arm’s length away from frontwoman Claire L. Evans, and she was able to leave the stage and dance through the crowd. Now, YACHT’s audience nearly fills Rough Trade, which has a capacity of 250. I can barely scope out a space by the bar. I feel like a proud mother.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When the trio takes to the stage, Evans gives the introductions, and quips of the band’s latest album, <em>Chain Tripping</em>, “I wasn’t gonna bring it up but it’s Grammy-nominated. I guess they let anyone in these days.\" While known for whimsicality, the band wears simple outfits for the performance &mdash; Evans, the lead singer and emcee for the night, dons all black, her platinum blond hair gleaming in contrast. Jona Bechtolt, producer<strong>,</strong> wears black and white stripes and stands to Evans’s right, alternating between roundtables and a guitar. Rob Kieswetter (also known as Bobby Birdman), a collaborator and YACHT’s additional touring member, is dressed in a black jacket and plays guitar during the show.</p>\r\n<p>Many people in the audience seemed unfamiliar with <em>Chain Tripping</em>, which is understandable given its newness as well as its tone &mdash; heavier and more subdued than previous albums, it marks a break from the upbeat style of YACHT’s previous work. However, it is an extremely intricate album, with layers upon layers of sound mixing with Evans’ airy voice to create the techno-psychedelic-pop sound that only YACHT can ever quite achieve. The packed crowd responds well, dancing throughout the night as YACHT performs the album in its entirety.</p>\r\n<p>What YACHT withholds in their costumes they bring forth through their background visuals, fitting for a group so highly influenced by and coyly critical of technology. When the band performs “California Dali,” the song’s title waves and pulsates across the screen in a retro VHS font. Later, the “Blue on Blue” music video plays in the background of the song’s performance. Demonstrating the band’s inventive relationship with technology, the video includes computer-generated images of the band members’ faces. A slide of text in the video’s introduction explains them as “hallucinated” faces based on “thousands of photos and 4K videos of [the band members’] faces as [they] moved through a range of emotions.” At times, I get so sucked into the visuals that I forget to watch the stage itself. While overwhelming in certain moments, the visuals succeed in immersing me in the concert, drawing the venue tightly around me.</p>\r\n<p>YACHT does not shy away from politics in their music, discussing the perils of capitalism and advocating for women’s rights. This holds true during the concert, with Evans declaring, “THIS IS A SONG ABOUT ANIMAL RIGHTS!” before the band performs “Hard World.” In the background, the song’s music video plays, featuring cartoon anthropomorphic feet engaged in activities like driving to work in traffic and watching TV. The protagonist is a working-class male foot, dismayed by the mundanity of everyday life. On his way home from work, he hits every red light, while his smug neighbor in a flashy sports car hits all the green ones. In the last scene, the foot tries to kill himself, but the bullet slips in between his toes and misses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This is awesome to watch, but largely distracting while the band performs in front of the video. Evans bemoans animal cruelty in her lyrics, singing, “<em>the saddest thing about an animal is how quickly its death doesn’t matter. It’s a living, breathing being...and then a thing being swept down the gutter.</em>” The band also gently prods at capitalism with “Sad Money” (“the song is called ‘Sad Money’ because all money is sad!”, says Evans).</p>\r\n<p>Their “finale” (before two encore songs) is the band’s cover of “Le Goudron,” an atypical choice for the end of a show &mdash; “Le Goudron” is a surreal, apocalyptic song recorded entirely in French by Brigitte Fontaine in 1949. YACHT’s homage to Fontaine is seductive, electric, haunting, and impossible to sing along to unless you know French. Because of this, the moment belongs to Evans, as she croons the upbeat melody alone in her first and native language. This was, of course, amazing, but nonetheless, not enough to satiate the eager crowd.</p>\r\n<p>The audience yearns for one song in particular: I hear someone behind me at the bar moan, “play ‘Psychic City!’”, a reference to YACHT’s hit track (24 million plays on Spotify), and the first song I ever heard by them. The band obliges and plays the encore, delighting the audience as we jump up and down to the dreamy, psychedelic tune and sing along to the wordless chorus. As soon as the song begins to play, the energy levels in the room spike. It is one of their happiest tunes (in title and content it beats “Sad Money” and “Hard World”). I remember listening to this song in years past during cold winters and sad times, and as everyone at the concert sings, “<em>I told you your dreams would come true!</em>”, a poignant, thoughtful warmth descends over the room.</p>",

		"title" : "Taping Down Istanbul",
		"slug" : "tapingdownistanbul",
		"body" : "<p>I like talking about where I’m from. Occasionally I talk about it so much that I end up inviting people to see it for themselves, and some of them actually come. My roommate Roberto was subjected to this treatment by his three Turkish friends, myself included. So instead of going to his hometown on the US-Mexico border, he ended up spending two weeks of his winter break on the other side of the world, visiting us in Istanbul.&nbsp;<br></p>\r\n<p>After his 6th day in the city, he had run the gamut of all the must-see sights: all the churches and the palaces and the monuments and the churches-turned-into-mosques and the mosques-modeled-after-churches. There is a tendency to conceive of Istanbul exclusively as a historical city, so I wanted Roberto to visit something from this century. My mother suggested Arter, the newest addition to Istanbul’s contemporary arts scene.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>From 2010 to 2018, Arter operated in a building by İstiklal Avenue. The Avenue and the surrounding district of Pera, home to all sizes of artistic establishments ranging from Turkey’s most famous museums to chic art boutiques, is seen as the heart of Istanbul’s contemporary&nbsp; art scene. In September 2019, Arter moved away from İstiklal Avenue to a new and significantly larger home in the Dolapdere district.</p>\r\n<p>As we were driving around Dolapdere, Roberto told me that, for the first time, he didn’t know where the sea was. The trip that we had curated for him had highlighted the shores of the Bosphorus: mosques and palaces of the Golden Horn, bougie restaurants and clubs between the two bridges, ferry rides along the sea. In Turkish, we consider the Bosphorus, the strait that passes through the city of Istanbul, along the divide between Europe and Asia, to be more than just a waterway. It is the “throat” of the city. Yet the residents of Dolapdere, like millions of other residents of Istanbul, are estranged from the Bosphorus. What is essential to my definition of Istanbul becomes contingent, or even absent, in theirs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Though just fifteen minutes away from Pera, Dolapdere has little in common with the arts district. With its auto shops and traditional coffee houses, Dolapdere is a working class neighborhood struck hard by the post-industrial turn in the Turkish economy. The building that now houses Arter used to be an auto service garage, heavily renovated, after a great deal of legal and financial trouble, to house the museum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The surrounding apartment buildings are as organic as concrete gets. As we approached, Arter’s monolithic structure stood apart from them with its smooth concrete surface and glass walls. Just behind the building, locals strolled around a street bazaar that had been set up for the day. At the coffee houses, the “uncles” of the neighborhood continued to sip their tea as they went on with their daily schedule of watching cars pass along the main road. A weird sense of calm set in as I observed the seamless navigation of Dolapdere’s residents around Arter’s alien form.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Like its location, everything within the building feels purposeful. Arter is able to host multiple exhibits at a time (there were 6 when I visited this winter). While the exhibits are unrelated, the architecture of the building with its frequent use of glass walls and pieces hung by the stairs orchestrates a continuous viewing experience.</p>\r\n<p>The defunct metal detector that we encountered mid-way through our visit was the only indication that we were entering the next exhibit. As we walked past the detector into a large hall with spacious walls painted white, I noticed a set of rocks stuck to the floor with black PVC tape. Walking around the room, I was interrupted by museum staff and told not to cross. Apparently, while chasing rocks, I had attempted to cross an opening which was reserved for a life-size pelican statue moving on an automated railway.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After the warning I carefully walked to the other side of the room, having to lift my head up from the trail of rocks to make sure that I didn’t hit the lamps hung at irregular heights. In the end, I arrived at another metal detector, once again dysfunctional, and passed through to a room which finally announced that the pale biosphere I had encountered was in fact Ayşe Erkmen’s exhibit titled <em>Whitish</em>, curated by Emre Baykal. Having started her career as a sculptor, Erkmen has gained acclaim with her decontextualized mimesis of environments, and is seen today as one of Turkey’s foremost visual artists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The piece appeared to me a textbook example of the sort of contemporary art exhibit that confuses people, for good reason. <em>Whitish </em>is an elaborate statement against an understanding of art according to which one discovers meaning in elaborate symbolism or exquisite beauty. Instead of vibrancy, <em>Whitish</em> offers, well, a whitish color. Before you can discuss what it means, you have to discuss whether the color is there in the first place or whether it’s just plain white.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Roberto told me he’d hardly noticed the metal detectors, since he had gotten used to passing through them in the Istanbul subway and almost all museums. With rocks, lamps, and birds, Erkmen’s biome cannot be called unnatural. Yet it refuses to imitate: the piece renders its naturality absurd, reminding the viewer of the artist’s authority. It was the artist who had taped the rocks to the ground, arranged the irregular lighting, and stationed staff to protect the pelican’s migration route. Rejecting the authority of nature, <em>Whitish</em> is a parody of the color white. Its mockery is disturbingly intentional.</p>\r\n<p>Power-grabbing intentionality permeates Istanbul’s architectural landscape. Throughout history, political groups that came to power attempted to make Istanbul their own, in a physical sense. The city’s most prominent monument, the Hagia Sophia, a former cathedral, is a testament to this trend. Under the Ottomans, the Hagia Sophia gained its minarets and became a mosque. With the advent of the Turkish republic, it became a monument to secular modernity: a museum. Today, the cityscape remains the symbolic battleground of the power struggle between the conservative and the secular elites. While a new mosque rises at Taksim square, once designed to be the heart of Istanbul’s secular life, the construction of Arter represents an attempt by the secular elite to extend past its old boundaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Arter’s mission statement of “bringing together artists and audiences through celebration of today’s art” and “making its broad range of programmes accessible to everyone” is a bold one, and the gallery makes an active effort. The first view that strikes you when you walk into the building is a massive glass wall that separates the cafeteria from an outdoor area that is reminiscent of a forum. The forum, which I imagine will be used more actively come summer, is dwarfed by the working-class apartment buildings of Dolapdere. At that point, the forum in all its grandeur becomes a gallery of its own.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>“This neighbourhood reminds me of Mexico, in a weird way,” said Roberto, looking through the glass. It was a running joke between us that Turkey was a Latin American country. It’s a light-hearted joke about our shared sense of humor, food taste and messed up politics. Yet it’s also a reminder of our shared history of uneven development. It’s a shared knowledge of the thickness of the glass wall dividing the gallery and the neighborhood.</p>\r\n<p>The three of us watched the glass wall longer than any piece of art. Despite having free admission, Arter hadn’t attracted the bazaar goers to explore the world of Turkish contemporary art. At the same time, my mother, having lived in the country for 50 years, had felt the same impulse as Roberto to take a picture of the buildings beyond the wall. To the Turkish museum goer, the “outside” was the most exotic. Throughout the galleries of Arter, the frequent usage of glass serves as a constant and intentional reminder to the elite museumgoer of where they are. In this regard, Arter succeeds in bringing its visitor together with Dolapdere, and allows for them to make contact with the neighborhood, even if through an alien spaceship. Yet my worry is that the museumgoer will forget the thickness of that wall and deem that contact to be sufficient.</p>\r\n<p>Can contact ever be sufficient? While taking Roberto around, I realized that the artifacts I introduced as representative of my culture, my city, and my way of life were fundamentally estranged from me. To what extent can I own the cobalt ceramics of the Blue Mosque or the cobblestone pavements of the Golden Horn, or the wooden seats of the ferry, or a mechanical pelican’s migration route? My attempt at showing Roberto my version of the city was as absurd as trying to tape down a piece of stone to call it mine. I don’t know if Arter will make the Turkish contemporary art scene more accessible to the public, but it certainly helps in exposing its limits, just as it has exposed the limits of “my” Istanbul.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

		"slug" : "EricNam",
		"body" : "<p><em>Interview by Woojin Lim and Celina Hollmichel</em></p>\r\n<p><em>The following conversation belongs to a series of interviews with Asian artists with international upbringings who have traveled across continents to share their art with audiences in both the East and the West, and sought to bridge the divide between identities and artforms. Their works have served as a powerful testament to Asian representation across the world.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Myself a Korean-Canadian, I sit down with these artists to ask about their lives as eager students and inspiring mentors, travelers finding their way around roadblocks, creators of art.</em></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>We met Eric Nam backstage at the Royale moments before his concert in Boston, one of many venues on his North American tour which were completely sold out. Clad in a flashy orange jacket, Eric sat cross-legged on a rolling chair, smiling at us. After a warm handshake, he offered us a bottle of water and some cashews that Celina turned down, “I just had some earlier today”&mdash;to which he laughed and said, “yeah do your thing,” as we sat down beside him on the couch. The Korean-American artist, known for his smooth pop and R&B hits, had just arrived from New York earlier that day&mdash;he’d been traveling all across North America for the US leg of his <em>Before We Begin</em> world tour.</p>\r\n<p>Eric calls Boston his “second home.” Though born and bred in Atlanta, Georgia, he graduated from Boston College, where he studied international relations and Asian studies, and interned at Deloitte over a summer right by the Prudential Center. As a young man preparing for a career in finance, Eric turned his world upside down when a viral YouTube cover secured him a place in one of Korea’s popular TV series, <em>Star Audition: Birth Of A Great Star 2</em>. Since placing in the top five on <em>Star Audition</em>, Eric has hosted a number of TV programs and interviewed some of Western media’s most famous celebrities, making him an all-around talent on top of being a widely acclaimed musical artist.</p>\r\n<p>The crowd’s expectant enthusiasm could be heard from the chartreuse-wallpapered dressing room where we interviewed the renowned interviewer himself. Eric told us about his artist’s vision, his belief in ghosts, the crucial balance of happiness and health, and why Asian and Asian-American representation matters.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: So <em>Before We Begin</em>, how has your global tour been so far? Are you enjoying life on the bus?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>A: It’s exhausting, but when your job is to do what you love, you can’t complain too much. [The North American tour] started like February 1st, and it’s been twenty days. We have about 40-something days left. I’ve been seeing a lot of people around the States, visiting and connecting with old friends. So it’s been a great time.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: You’ve conducted quite a number of interviews yourself. What is your favorite question to ask your guests?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>A: Do you believe in ghosts or have you seen a ghost?</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: How would you respond to this question?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>A: I think there are probably ghosts in the world. I have not seen one but I feel like I felt the presence of one. In Korea there’s been a superstition that ghosts love music, so they’re always in a studio or a dance-training place. I’ve had, like, very scary moments. [...] I’m sure there are.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: So you’ve been to a lot of places, especially now, but also in and out of college. What have been some of the most valuable lessons that you’ve taken from these experiences?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>A: Even throughout college and post-college, I’ve always been incredibly hyperactive. Even at Boston College, I was involved in so many different organizations and initiatives. I remember my friends saying to me, “you’re actually insane.” It’s because I never slept. I still don’t sleep, but it’s just kind of the way I’m wired.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I’m the type of person that if I feel strongly about something and if I really want to do something, I’m just gonna do it. And if it works out, amazing, and it’s like “I told you so,” but if it doesn’t work out, that’s fine. It’s a learning experience for you to take opportunities and things that you are passionate about, and take calculated risks full steam ahead. That’s probably been my career as well. All common sense says, “why would you give up a perfectly good paying job in New York with your friends to appear on a TV show and maybe make something of yourself?” But I’m a testament to living that way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: <em>Before We Begin</em> is your first all-English album. How has being an artist in South Korea influenced how you approached being a musician here in the United States?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>A: This album was meaningful in the sense that it is my first English album. For the past nine years since I’ve been in Korea, the big goal has always been to come back to the States and become a recording artist and entertainer. So trying to say, “how do we reverse-engineer success we’ve had in Korea and try to make it apply here in the States?” I thought that putting out an album in English would be the first step. I wanted this to make an introduction to Eric Nam, which is why we titled it <em>Before We Begin</em>. It’s different from Korea since there’s a very distinct and defined way of promoting an album in Korea. The States is [...] new territory for me and my team.</p>\r\n<p>The other most important thing is that it’s still new for so many Asian and Asian American people. We don’t have a lot of representation, and we don’t have a lot of people who are going to fight for us to be in certain places. I think that was the biggest challenge. But what’s been encouraging is, since we’ve released the album, we’ve been meeting so many incredible people who are willing to take a chance and be allies and say “K-pop is cool, Asians are cool, Parasite is hella awesome.” We’re having a moment as Asians and Asian Americans, and it’s about time. I feel like it’s a very timely album.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: How has the reception been to your album in the United States? Have there been any particular responses or interactions that stuck out to you?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>A: For me, it’s always great to have fans react well to it, and have the press react well to it. But the most validating thing for me is when other artists really like my stuff. So after I released [<em>Before We Begin</em>], a lot of different artists, particularly in Korea, reached out and said things like “this album’s amazing,” “how did you put this together?” “there’s nobody else into music like you,” and it’s true. In Korea right now, you’re either going to go towards the idol route where there are highly produced dance tracks, or you’re going to be going the R&B and hip-hop route like Zico, Jay Park, or Zion-T. But there’s nobody [in Korea] who really does pop, and that was kind of the intention for me. [...]</p>\r\n<p>But [my label] was like “well, you should do ballads.” I don’t like ballads. So I was like, “Look, instead of trying to make me like Zion-T and instead of making me like somebody else, I can do something that’s distinctly Eric Nam that only I can do because I’m Korean American.” That was, like, years of discussion, but we got to that point. I’d say from the <em>Honestly</em> album to this last album, there’s a color that I’ve established as Eric Nam sound that people in Korea are excited about.<br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: If you could collaborate with anyone, who would you want to collaborate with?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>A: I’m down for anybody. My last answer was John Legend or Bruno Mars. They were just so formative in my music career. In Korea, I’m legit down for anybody. [...] I think part of what I’ve realized is that people view me as this hybrid of celebrity because I did some TV. Some people see me as unapproachable in the scene because I’m just everywhere in so many different ways. So they’re like “he would never do it,” but when they do come and I’m like “yeah, I’ll do it,” they’re shocked. I haven’t done a lot in Korea, but I’m down for anything really.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: What is your vision as an artist, and what makes your work so meaningful for you?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>A: I don’t know if that’s so much of “as an artist,” but just as a person, trying to be happy and healthy. No matter what you do, you should enjoy it. You should really find passion in it. I went through my 20s working so much, and I still do. The last vacation I took was 2018. I’m dead serious. It was like three or four days in Bali. That was the last time I had a break. I even work Christmas Day, New Year’s Day, New Year’s Eve, Christmas Eve, like every day. When you work like that, you think you’re going to be okay, but then I started having health issues because I was over-stressed and overworking. Then I realized how important it is to be healthy and to take care of yourself. For me, yes, I’m happy because I do what I love and I love what I do. But without health, you’re screwed.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: Since you spent your undergrad here at Boston College, what were some fun or embarrassing moments in college? How is it to be back in Boston?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>A: I can’t tell you the embarrassing ones. Way too many.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>No, I had a great time in Boston. Boston is one of those cool cities where it feels like a second home. [...] I obviously spend my undergraduate years here. I also spent a summer here interning at Deloitte, where I lived right next to the Prudential Center. Summer here is great as well. There’s something about it that makes me feel like I’m kind of coming home, every time I’m here. I’m excited for the show tonight, and I hope to just keep coming back whenever I can.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: If there’s any advice that you could give to yourself back in college what would it be?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>A: Do what you want to do. That’s such a cliché thing to say, but I truly feel like if you are doing what you love, and if you are loving what you do, you’re going to be fine. Even if you don’t make the most money in the world or whatever. I didn’t make money for years. I took a job becoming a singer, giving up a great-paying job at Deloitte. I didn’t make money for like the first four or five years. That’s incredibly disheartening in many ways. But for me, because I was so excited and passionate about music, it didn’t matter. I was like, “I’ll get there, I’ll get there.”</p>\r\n<p>I’m glad I graduated from college. I’m glad I got a job. I’m glad I did everything. But every once in a while, I think, “Man, I wish I had just gone to Korea earlier and started even before.” I’m so thankful that I am where I am, but I wonder what it’d be like if I had had a couple years of actual training, because I never got training.</p>\r\n<p>The other thing to keep in mind is that life is long, and you have so many opportunities. Take all of whatever you want to do, and just take everything you can. You should just be unapologetically you.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: Is there anything else you’d like to share with us that we haven’t yet touched?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>A: Outside of music, I’m always working on podcasts and TV shows, bringing all these different things together. As an Asian American, we’re at a very critical point where we need more young people to be excited and get involved. You can do whatever you want now. The barriers are coming down and it’s an exciting time for anybody. Just pursue what you love and you’ll get there. I keep repeating myself, but that’s it.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>After the interview, Eric asked us whether we’d be staying for the show. Of course we would.</p>\r\n<p>The Royale, at full capacity, did not leave us much standing room. Yet, we found a space in the back from which to cheer for Eric’s entrance, heralded by blue strobe lights shining across the sea of fans, and even to catch Eric’s smiling eye for a brief moment. It was a long night of music, body-rolls deemed “too sexy” by his mom, and interludes of “TED talks and backstories.” Here’s one story:</p>\r\n<blockquote><em>Let’s slow down for a minute, I’ve got a little story to tell you. So I’m gonna tell a story about mom again, ’cause aside from the body rolling, she also after a show came up to me and goes “Eric, I’m so glad it’s over.” And I’m like “Thanks?” “Yeah, whenever you do a show, I have the worst anxiety because I know you’re just gonna mess it up.” “Thanks mom.”</em></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><em>That’s kind of how I was raised. She was never the most accepting of my career choice to be a singer. But I realized more recently: she’s becoming more “American.” Let me explain [...] For example, a few weeks ago, I got a text that goes, “Dear, Eric...” If you have an Asian mom, you know no Asian moms start with “Dear Eric.” It starts with “야! (YAH!)” That’s how it starts. So I get a “Dear Eric” text and it’s like “I’m so proud of you.” WHAT? She’s definitely hacked or abducted. [...] And then she says “I’m so proud of you for pursuing a non-conventional career path.” Again, she’s definitely abducted. That is an SAT word she would not use.</em></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><em>But why am I telling you this in the middle of the show? The reason I tell this story is because I truly from the bottom of my heart, appreciate every single person that is here tonight. It’s a Friday night in Boston, and you guys could be doing anything else. But you guys are here. The reason that’s crazy is because, me, a southern Korean American kid from Georgia had to go to Korea to be able to come and sing for you guys in Boston. It took 10 years for me to be doing the tour that I’m doing today.</em></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><em>The point is: you being here is not only a cool moment and a great memorable experience for me and hopefully for you, but you guys are taking part in a cultural movement that pushes for diversity. So thank you so much.</em></blockquote>",

		"body" : "<p><em>The following conversation belongs to a series of interviews with Asian artists with international upbringings who have traveled across continents to share their art with audiences in both the East and the West, and sought to bridge the divide between identities and artforms. Their works have served as a powerful testament to Asian representation across the world.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><em>Myself a Korean-Canadian, I sit down with these artists to ask about their lives as eager students and inspiring mentors, travelers finding their way around roadblocks, creators of art.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Born in Thailand and raised in New Zealand, guitarist and singer-songwriter Phum Viphurit became a viral sensation for his mellow neo-soul, indie-pop, self-termed “hazy sunshine music and moonlight pop.” There is no single genre, though he thinks, that captures his music.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Equipped with a fresh diploma from film school, Phum views his music as an art of film: it’s a “cinematic” process from start to finish. He co-directed his most recent MV, “Softly Spoken,” which features smooth acoustic backdrops, colorful disco-like lights, and two strangers lost in the moment, waltzing. Phum says he’s most attached to this song right now at time of his life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Calling from the comfort of his home, Phum sent warmth from Bangkok despite the difficult times. “Long Gone” in conversation, we chatted over the phone about the subconscious connection between music and film, cultural norms and crowd surfing, and living as one with music.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>WL: So, how did this all begin? How did you begin your life as a musician?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>PV: I grew up in a household that was always playing music. My mom had a pretty big CD collection, and my brother was a singer since he was young. But I grew up like any kid. I tried a lot of things out. I played a lot of sports. I loved video games. I still do. But somehow I found my way to music around the age of 12 or 13 and started playing drums, playing the guitar, uploading covers on YouTube. I kept doing that without really thinking much of it, and now it’s my full time career which I’m super grateful for.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>When I was in freshman year of college in Bangkok, one of my friends in college was in a label at the time, and they showed my Frank Ocean cover that I did to the label [Rats Records]. I’m still with them now today.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>WL: Why music? What brought you to it, and what makes it meaningful for you?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>PV: Music is one of those rare art forms that sticks with you everywhere you go, even if you’re not consuming it directly. I love how a melody or song could get in the head and stay with you in whatever activity you’re doing. Say, you’re in high school, you’re studying, you think of a tune, and you can’t get it out of your head. It makes you wonder and imagine things. That’s what drew me to music the most.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>WL: How would you describe yourself and the sound you create?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>PV: This is hard because I feel like I’ve personally listened to a wide range of music. Although my songwriting is mostly associated with indie, indie pop, or bedroom pop, I definitely explore a lot more outside of that genre. I wouldn’t define it as anything. I’d rather let people interpret it however they want, because my sound will keep changing in the future.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>WL: Okay. Tell me more about your creative process. How do you start and where do you draw inspiration from?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>PV: I don’t really have a set method of how I do things. Sometimes I’ll come up with the chords. Sometimes it’s the melody first, or&mdash;let’s say for “Softly Spoken”&mdash;the riff first. Or sometimes I’ll have a phrase on my phone that I heard one of my friends say, and I will expand on that, put some context behind it, and create that to a body of lyrics. It really just depends on my mood. A few years ago, I wrote a song [“Run”] based on a Wes Anderson film I watched. I wish I had a more systematic way of working and writing music, but I don’t. If I did, I’d probably release music a lot faster, but it just comes and goes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>WL: Could you tell me a bit more about your most recent music video, “Softly Spoken”? What was the production process like?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>PV: I’ve always wanted to make a very situational music video. “Softly Spoken” is a song I feel most attached to right now in this time of my life. The song speaks to me a lot of the time, and that’s how I feel about things in general. So I directed it with a friend of mine and got some friends to help out. It’s about two strangers meeting and having a moment together. That’s how I would define it. It’s kind of like the things you overlook but are really special. I just wanted to shine the light on that.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>WL: How has your experience in film shaped your approach to music?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>PV: I feel like that connection is very subconscious. I didn’t study music, like, theoretically. When I write a song, I feel that my thought process is quite different from someone who studies music and knows all the notes and what they’re called. I look at my songs in a graph. I break it into the intro and the climax. I kind of think of it in a cinematic way.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>WL: Have there been any particular song lyrics that you’ve struggled to write?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>PV: I like to write minimal words. I’ve never written a song with a really long verse. I also tend to fall back on this Dr. Seuss theory, where I rhyme a lot of my words. This is just a style that I like. The challenge for me is always: how do I say what I want to say with the fewest words possible? I feel like when you can do that, you leave a lot of space for the audience to interpret. Every song I’ve ever written, I found it challenging to find the right words that I could sing comfortably, and that make the most sense to what I’m trying to say in that particular song.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>WL: You’ve started by writing a lot of singles, but when you’re now designing a larger album, how do you decide which songs to put together?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>PV: I’m working on that process right now. It’s a lot different because before this, I used to just write single by single, then compile them together into an album. Right now I’m kind of thinking more. I guess when you write an album, it’s a lot more cinematic. If you compare it to a movie or TV show, an episode of a TV show is like a single, while an album is more like an entire season or an entire film. There is a more cohesive, conceptual message you’re trying to get through. I’m working my way through that right now.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>WL: Last year, you went on your first North American tour. How did that go? Any memorable experiences?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>PV: The farthest I went last year was the States. That’s the first time I did an extensive US tour. We played about fifteen shows, and two in Canada, which was amazing because I never thought I’d get to go to Canada. It sounds so foreign when you lived in New Zealand&mdash;it feels like the other side of the world. The best memory apart from all the shows, which were a blast to play, was probably seeing Niagara Falls. First time seeing something that big. It was pretty cool.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>WL: What’s been your favorite song to perform?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>PV: For me, “Long Gone” is my favorite song. Before the whole “Lover Boy” song blew up, “Long Gone” was my first one to gain feedback from audiences overseas. It has a lot of value to me personally. I wrote it when I was 17 when I was leaving New Zealand and moving on to the next phase of my life. Whenever we perform it, we perform it during the encore, if there is an encore at our show (which has happened every time&mdash;I’m super grateful.) It means a lot when everyone jams out and lets loose.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>WL: How was the audience reception compared to back home?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>PV: People are a lot more involved overseas when you play a live show. I guess the culture is different. Generally in Asian countries, people are more conservative. So they won’t scream in between the songs too much. They’ll clap once the song is finished. Not that they’re not interested in the show. It’s just a different sort of physical behavior when compared to a European or American audience. I remember I played a show at a UCSD [University of California San Diego], and by the second song, there were a lot of people crowd surfing already when we played a really slow song. Everyone was like “yeah these kids came to party.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>WL: How was it coming back home to Thailand after your trip? Do you feel at home where you are?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>PV: I do. I’ve always based home where my family and where my closest friends are. Right now, everybody is in Thailand, as in Bangkok. So I feel comfortable here even if I don’t fit in with all the cultural norms, or I live a different lifestyle. I still feel like this is my home.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>I don’t find anything too strange because I’ve been here for five years now since I’ve moved back. But here, people’s taste in music and entertainment is very different. Me being someone who consumes a lot of that and being surrounded by people who are into the same sort of entertainment but had very different tastes than me was quite strange at first, but I got used to it and I’ve found my crowd.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>WL: If there’s one thing you would hope your audiences to take away from your music, what would that be?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>PV: It would be to “take it easy.” The world’s really stressed out right now, especially in 2020. There are lots of difficulties for everybody working in any field. If you’re like a kid going through high school, or university, I’m sure your parents are very stressed out as well. I really hope my music is an escape&mdash;that people don’t take it too seriously. If they do, I hope they are inspired to pursue their own path in the arts and whatever professional they choose. I really hope that it has a positive aftertaste.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>WL: Are there any musicians that you admire, or any musicians you’d like to collaborate with?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>PV: When I was younger, I looked up to this band called “Bombay Bicycle Club.” They’re from the UK that I was a big fan of “Young the Giant”, this band from California. Later on, I picked up “Mac DeMarco.” He’s still a huge inspiration to me to this day. I also listen to a lot of “Daft Punk” as well. [Regarding collaborations,] I have too many I think I would love to work with. I’d love to one day work with “The Whitest Boy Alive”&mdash;they’re a band formed in Berlin. That’s who I can think off the top of my head right now.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>WL: What for you makes a good musician?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>PV: Someone who you instantly see and you know they’re not pretending to be someone else? When you see [good musicians] play music, they exemplify what their music is about. They live in the music, the music is them, and they are one. It’s not just an artist singing a good song or an amazing guitarist playing a beautiful guitar solo. I think you have to coexist with each other. That’s my idea for a legit musician. They do it for the love and when you see them you just know.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>WL: How would you define success in this industry?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>PV: Let me think. For me, it’s been getting to travel. That’s always been a dream of mine. But I don’t know. People have different definitions of success. For me, I thought it was successful when I finished my first single in 2015, shot a low budget video for it, had it out as my own song. I found that incredibly satisfying. The rest of whatever came after that, I guess it was a bonus to me. I never expected much from music. So I guess that’s why I have this quite laid-back attitude to music. But it varies for everybody. Success is when you’re doing what you love, it becomes your profession, and even in that shift, you’re still loving what you’re doing. I think that’s true success in becoming a musician.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>WL: If you have any advice for any current students or artists, filmmakers or musicians, what would that be?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>PV: Take your time with it. There’s no need to rush to get your content out there just because everybody is active. I feel like nowadays everybody is comparing themselves to each other on social media all the time, to the point that they feel pressured to be a certain someone and be relevant in a certain way, when in reality, it doesn’t really matter.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>You don’t have to run everywhere, you know. Enjoy the journey of walking. Take a few stops. If it’s meant to happen, it’s gonna happen. Not that you shouldn’t work for it, but don’t force it. Beautiful things don’t crave attention. People will come to it, and it will grow its own tree.</p>",

Channeling their playful spirit, I wrote in my review that Epik High had a “truly ‘epik’ team chemistry.”</p>\r\n<p>Leader of the veteran South Korean hip-hop trio, rapper and producer Tablo is known for his stylish flow, versatile melodies, and lyrical depth. Born in Seoul and raised in Jakarta and Vancouver, Tablo says that interacting with different people, personalities, and ideologies helped him incorporate multiple perspectives in his creative process. By the age of sixteen, Tablo’s poems got the attention of famous Korean singer Kim Gun-mo, who made a song [“Rainy Christmas”] based off of Tablo’s lyrics.</p>\r\n<p>Studying English at Stanford, Tablo continued to pursue his musical interests, joining an underground hip hop group, 4n Objectz, and performing at talent shows and clubs around San Francisco. But once he started his artist’s career in Korea, Tablo suffered an onslaught of backlash from Internet scandal-mongers labelling themselves “Tajinyo” who refused to believe that he graduated from Stanford.</p>\r\n<p>Armed with these “most publicized troubles,” Tablo unabashedly raps about his personal hardships, bouts of depression, and sleeplessness. Even after fact-checks by the police and the release of a two-part documentary series titled “Tablo Goes to Stanford,” Tablo struggles to fight off the haters. Nevertheless, Tablo has pushed forth in his storytelling career, releasing new music, publishing books filled with inspiring aphorisms, and touring concert venues across the world.</p>\r\n<p>Tablo and I talked about his love for conscious rap and Bob Dylan, his college highlights, coping with Tajinyo troubles, and his none-too-modest self appraisal, or as rappers might call it, “swag.”</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WL: Could you tell me more about your transition from writing lyrics to creating your own music?</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><br><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p>T: As a child, I was always interested in telling stories. It didn’t really matter to me what form my story took. At first, writing came natural because it was just the easiest thing to do with a limited amount of equipment. You don’t need money to get a piece of paper and a pencil. That’s what I gravitated to because that’s what I had.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Sometime during high school and college, I was heavily into music as a hobby. But some of my initial raps were horrible. As I was trying to teach myself how to write rap lyrics, it occurred to me that writing hip hop lyrics gave me the same sensation as when I was writing prose or poetry. I enjoyed the fact that I could have something on paper first and then be able to perform it for other people and gauge their reactions. I fell in love with that, and eventually, I leaned heavier into music. The way I write my lyrics is why a lot of [Epik High’s] songs translate well to paper. If you just print out my lyrics and read them, there’s a smooth transition.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WL: How has your global upbringing shaped your worldview and approach to music?</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><br><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p>T: It’s less about the fact that I’ve experienced different locations and cultures but more that I’ve interacted with different people&mdash;the sheer amount of different personalities, different ideologies, different things that people care about. That exposure definitely allows me to have a very developed perspective on all things. I’ll read a line in a book, see something in a film, or experience something in a conversation, and I’ll understand, for instance, what “love” can be through multiple lenses. Whereas my [Epik High] members might have one perspective, I’ll simultaneously see multiple perspectives at the same time. This helps when I’m in my creative process, trying to express something or flesh out an idea.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>One thing I embrace is that what I consider my identity to be will constantly change, and that it needs to change. I’ve been doing music for so long&mdash;it’s been 17 years and we have many albums. Recently, I did on my podcast an episode about Epik High’s music, and I had to go back to our early albums and listen a little bit. I realized that my albums, from the first album until now, document my identity, how it’s evolved, and become something new.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WL: Who have been your most personal lyrical influences?</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><br><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p>T: When I was growing up, I was really into Bob Dylan, which is ironic because he eventually won the Nobel Prize for Literature. I was also into The Beatles, Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana. Any music that was very lyrical, I was deep into. It was less about the melodies but more about the way people can play with words. I was really into NAS’s first album “Illmatic”&mdash;I think that was the first album I ever bought when I was a little kid. I fell in love with the way the images and scenes were painted with words.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WL: What were some lessons from your college years you took to heart?</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><br><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p>T: I didn’t go to college intending to learn a skill that I didn’t have, or to take my first steps into a career. I was coming from a family and a cultural environment where it’s expected of you to go&mdash;as I’m sure you understand. But I knew that I had to go, and I set my expectations to a level of my liking, which was to go there and try to experience a lot of different perspectives, a lot of different people, a lot of different ideas.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Literature was the perfect major for that because basically you’re just reading a bunch of ideas from people, present and past. Books are the result of someone feeling so compelled to write down their ideas&mdash;to be recorded and spoken to other people. Usually those ideas are either the most beautiful or the most dangerous ideas. I also realized recently that I did a minor in Asian Studies. I completely forgot that I did that. Back in Asia, being Asian is not something special because that’s what you are, and that’s what everyone around you is. Nothing’s out of the ordinary. Back in Korea where I grew up, Asian stories weren’t “Asian” stories&mdash;they were just stories. Ironically enough, I got exposed to a lot of Asian stories once I was out of Asia.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>When I went to college, I wanted to spend some time studying Asia because I wanted to get an outsider’s perspective on who I am and where I’m coming from. Asian stories in America were like flowers blooming in the terrain of the “other.” So I spent my college days focusing on things that would inform me of who I am, who I can be, and who I need to be. That’s why I got involved with Asian American Studies, the Asian American Theater Project, and other cultural organizations.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WL: Take me through your artistic process.</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><br><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p>T: As I mentioned earlier while talking about literature, I like to wait until I’m compelled to create. Luckily, I have been for a while in a position where I can choose to do that. I’m independent and pretty successful, so I am allowed to take the time. There’s no one pushing me to drop an album everyday. I am very blessed and fortunate that I can do this, so I like to just experience life as much as I can. Then if there is a feeling or an emotion or an event that compels me to record it on paper or in sound, that’s when I start moving.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>The whole concept of writer’s block comes a lot to professional writers when they write like an athlete, constantly forcing themselves to meet a certain output standard. I was like that in the beginning of my career. I wrote like fifteen bars a day, and I had a very regimented system. But now, I wait for something to compel me. Once it does compel me, by the very nature of the fact that I’m compelled, there is no room to think about writer’s block or how difficult it is, because I am compelled.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Of course, waiting for that moment sometimes is very difficult and troubling. There will be stretches of time where nothing really happens in life, and there will be moments where I am compelled to write because something horrible is happening to me. But because I’m dealing with that horrible thing, it’s difficult for me to muster the energy to grab a pen.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>The more I give of myself in my work, and the more I open up, I feel that so much more is returned. I am more comfortable being in a conversation than giving a monologue. I have no problem opening myself up to people. I really have nothing to hide. That’s the irony of my career, I guess, because many of the terrible things that I went through was a result of too much conversation and too much of me being opened up to the public. But paradoxically, that’s also what brings out the best in me and makes me who I am. It is this weird cycle of things.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WL: When you’re dealing with these “horrible” things&mdash;say, the Tajinyo incident&mdash;what have been your coping mechanisms?</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p>T: When I encountered my most publicized troubles, luckily, I had just gotten married and had a child. This goes both ways. Having a family right at the moment of your worst time is really difficult because you’re riddled with guilt for not being able to protect your family&mdash;for making them go through something that they have no part in. But at the same time, having family is an incredible support system. Family reminds you that you have something to fight for.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Music also played a role. At this time, I wrote my first and only solo album called <em>Fever’s End</em>. When I was making that album, I wasn’t even aware I was making an album. I just had to do something so that I wouldn’t go crazy. The music did help me cope, but I wasn’t really aware that I was creating an album for public consumption. I just needed to put it out.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WL: How is the hip hop scene in Korea compared to that in the States?</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><br><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p>T: Hip hop is a genre where things change up within a week. Before we even make comparisons of hip hop in America to hip hop in Asia, if you take two rappers from America and you compare them, they won’t be the same. If you take two rappers from Asia and compare the two of them, they won’t be the same either. Hip hop is a beautiful thing because it is built on people being unique. Even if you compare two rappers from the same city, you’re not going to get the same type of vibe or personality. That’s just the way hip hop is and that’s what makes hip hop so awesome.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Even in the States, what’s hot today will not be so hot a week later. It’s the same way in Korea. When I started back in the day in 2003, hip hop had been around but a lot of people just didn’t get it. But now hip hop is the most popular genre in Korea, which mirrors the way it is anywhere else in the world right now. It basically is mainstream culture.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WL: What makes hip hop meaningful for you?</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><br><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p>If anything, the first rappers and DJs that helped create “hip hop” gave a huge gift to youth everywhere, because I can’t think of another genre or artform where this kind of uniqueness is allowed. Some will say rock and roll, but I’m not even sure that even rock can measure up. In everything we watch and consume within pop culture, I don’t think there is a single thing that hasn’t been influenced by hip hop. Even in the films that we’re watching right now, there are sensibilities and attitudes that are clearly influenced by hip hop. Shows like Atlanta, obviously, to comedy like Dave Chapelle, to even modern art in Guggenheim or MoMA&mdash;I guarantee you that you won’t be able to find a museum or gallery that doesn’t display art influenced by hip hop.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>But the hip hop that I grew up listening to and that got me passionate about doing it at the beginning, the music that I was listening to, and where my core values are musically&mdash;that’s still there. At the time, I was listening to a lot of conscious rap and backpack hip hop. When I got heavy into hip hop, a lot of the rappers were talking about their struggles. It was very cultural. I respected that, I fell in love with that, and I learned a lot from it. Even like 17 years later, I’m still trying to make music in a way where it honors that and all of what I felt back in the day. Whether or not that’s still relevant in 2020, it really doesn’t matter to me. Hip hop is an incredible gift, and in what I try to do with it, I’m trying to honor that.</p>\r\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WL: What’s in store for you next?</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><br><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p>T: Right now I’m completely focused on Epik High’s next album. We’re really deep into the creative process as we speak. I think it’s an important album for us because it’s our tenth full length studio album. There aren’t many hip hop groups in Korea that have hit that number. We’re performing at Coachella in October now. The end of 2020 is gonna be a very important time for us and our fans.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>As I was saying at the beginning of our conversation, fundamentally, I am a storyteller. That’s what I want to do. That’s what I love to do. And that’s what I believe that I exist to do. I am slowly getting interested in telling stories in different forms whether it be writing, TV, or film. I’d like to be able to tell stories in ways other than music.</p>\r\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WL: Do you have any advice for current students or aspiring artists?</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><br><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p>T: I guess it would be the advice that I’ve always been following. Do what compels you to do it, and at times, you have to wait for something to compel you. If you’re too busy and too preoccupied, when this thing that is supposed to compel you to do something arrives at your doorstep, you might miss it.</p>",

		"body" : "<p><em>These weird days, the Poetry Board has been reading some poems (as one must hope it is wont to do), and we’re writing to share some of these with you. Each willing member has recommended one poem. Some are new discoveries for their recommenders, others are old friends, and still others have quickly become mainstays of their recommenders’ respective isolations. You can find each one for free online (click on any title for a link), so if you are reading this post&mdash;to quote Madi Howard’s rec below&mdash;you really have no excuse not to give them a try. These poems have deepened, clarified, eased and enlivened our respective quarantines. May they do for you whatever you need done.</em></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Owen Torrey recommends<strong> “</strong><a href=\"https://poems.com/poem/postscript/\"><strong>Postscript</strong></a><strong>” by Seamus Heaney</strong>:</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Deep into my second week of self-isolation, I found myself googling the same thing every day: <em>postscript seamus heaney.</em> It’s hard to say why the poem was such a tonic for me. Maybe it was its openness&mdash;the ocean on one side, the lake on the other, the horizon full and around. Or, how the poem pulls you tight into its movement, steering down through its sixteen lines. Mostly, though, I think I returned to “Postscript” for its sense of connection, its breathless awe at the togetherness of things. Everything named in the poem is, as Heaney says, “working off each other”&mdash;the wind and the light, the white and the white, the known and the strange. I still read the poem most days. It brings me some light to work off of. It might for you, too.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Madi Howard recommends <strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/151510/revision-5dc04e37720a8\"><strong>Revision</strong></a><strong>” by Jane Huffman</strong>:</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Jane Huffman is an incredibly talented young poet and, best of all, a doppelganger for beloved blog editor Polina Whitehouse! Huffman’s signature style pays very close attention to soundplay, word choice, and repetition. Because of this, “Revision,” like the rest of Huffman’s body of work, feels whimsical, creative, and imaginative while still asking provocative, thoughtful questions of the language involved. Almost all of her poems are short and easy reads, so you really have no excuse not to give her writing a try. Happy reading!</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Marie Ungar recommends <strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://poets.org/poem/what-living-do\"><strong>What the Living Do</strong></a><strong>” by Marie Howe</strong>:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>I am forever delighted to share a name with Marie Howe. Reading and re-reading “What the Living Do” has always been a kind of ritual for me. Last summer, living in the chaos of Manhattan for the first time, I found myself turning to this poem more and more in waiting moments, in which I suddenly wasn’t sure what to be doing. On the train, during my lunch break, lying on the ground after a run. It got to the point where I only had to type “wha” into my search bar for Google to fill in the entire link. During quarantine, which seems like one long waiting moment, I’ve found myself returning to this poem more than ever. Read it aloud to yourself. Let each line feel like re-discovering something familiar.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Ezra Lebovitz recommends <strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/04/the-end-of-poetry\"><strong>The End of Poetry</strong></a><strong>” by Ada Limón</strong>:</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>I really love this poem. It's what I think is at the heart of poetry (and maybe literature? maybe everything??): an attempt to communicate. She strips down the flowers and the tropes, revealing this desperate, manic plea for connection and understanding and touch. I read this out loud and by the end I was crying!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Tadhg Larabee recommends <strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://poets.org/poem/domestic-mysticism\"><strong>Domestic Mysticism</strong></a><strong>” by Lucie Brock-Broido</strong>:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>This March, we all experienced an unexpected homecoming. And two months later, it’s easy to see this homecoming only in the negative&mdash;as something which took away real life, jamming us back into childhood homes and selves. In “Domestic Mysticism,” Brock-Broido imagines homecoming as a miraculous event. The speaker returns to a magical domestic space, full of “Wizards, the Forlorn, / The Awkward, the Blinkers, (...) / Stutterers of Prayer.” It’s a space akin to a deeper domestic: the home inside the mind where Brock-Broido writes her poems, “dropping words like little pink fish eggs, unawares, slightly / Illiterate, often on the mark.” If you need a reminder that the quarantine experience can be creative, this poem might help. In its transformation of the domestic and its strange craft, it shows how beauty can grow within small spaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Polina Whitehouse recommends&nbsp;<strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/56833/it-was-the-animals\"><strong>It Was the Animals</strong></a><strong>” by Natalie Diaz</strong>:</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>If you’re caught in tight quarters with people you love but the word <em>love</em> looms too large for the quarters and the word <em>caught </em>seems apt, read this poem. I first encountered it during the flesh-and-blood part of this semester, when Diaz came to campus to give a reading whose force blew through the room, leaving a windfall of meanings. As I look back at the written text now, a few of its meanings stand out. This piece is about being close to someone, too close for comfort&mdash;sharing friction’s heat and much else. It’s about accepting someone else’s mythology and trusting someone enough to admit your own. It’s about the dangerous creatures filling the distances remaining between close ones pushed closer. And it tells its story through the language we now speak only to those we are living with&mdash;it talks in texture, temperature, and pressure, grounding myth and relationship in the touch of it all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

		"title" : "A Career Called Poet",
		"slug" : "acareercalledpoet",
		"body" : "<p>I have been writing poetry since I was about six years old, and made it through several years of Radcliffe thinking that there was a career called “poet,” in which I could make a living by writing poems. I’m not sure where I got that idea or how I sustained it, but perhaps it was because it was the sixties. I started at Radcliffe in fall 1966.<br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Some highlights I remember from those years: Borges and Robert Creeley’s visits and readings&mdash;the former so learned and beyond me, the latter so irreverent. Creeley started by saying he was thrilled to be reading at an institution that he’d been kicked out of! I remember at that time at Harvard, poetry ended with Robert Frost. I had to get some kind of special dispensation to write about the Black Mountain Poets after Creeley’s visit. Other highlights: Discovering Osip Mandelstam’s poems (then untranslated) in the Widener library stacks. The contrast between serving lunch at the Harvard Club and working as a waitress at the Blue Parrot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>All this time, I was writing (and very occasionally submitting) poetry. A poem of mine, “<a href=\"https://www.merylnatchez.com/tag/harvard-advocate#_ftn1\">Chameleons in Captivity</a>,” appeared in the December 1967 issue of <em>The</em> <em>Harvard Advocate</em>, a publication that literally changed my life.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>A Harvard alum in the creative writing graduate program at San Francisco State University brought the poem to class. He showed it to his friend, Larry Rafferty, who wrote me my first fan letter:</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<blockquote><em>Dear Meryl (I hope this is your real name),<br><br><br></em><em>I happened to see the issue of The Advocate in which your poem, “Chameleons in Captivity,” appeared. It is an exceptionally fine poem & I am moved to know more about you & see more of your work.&nbsp;<br><br></em><em>I was poetry editor of the literary magazine at U.C.L.A. I am now doing graduate work in Creative Writing at San Francisco State.&nbsp;<br><br></em><em>Hopefully, we could establish some sort of contact between what I’m told are very different worlds (I suspect that may be nothing but the confusion of external forms).&nbsp;<br><br></em><em>At any rate I’m including one of my poems so that you can decide whether or not you might find the relationship fruitful.&nbsp;<br><br><br></em><em>Larry Rafferty<br><br><br></em><em>P.S. I think the footnote is superfluous.&nbsp;</em></blockquote>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>You can imagine what a thrill it was to receive a letter from an older poet in mythical California. Distances were longer then.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>We began corresponding (actual letters back and forth!) and exchanging poems. We met in the summer of 1968 when he came through Cambridge on his way to Canada. Larry had decided to leave the country rather than serve in Vietnam. The best way to do this was through a network set up to support war resistors in Montreal. On his way, he stopped to meet me.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>I remember that evening so clearly. School was over for the summer, and I was a living in an attic apartment in Cambridge, a third-floor walkup. I had a difficult job working with autistic children in the state hospital in Waltham. It had been an awful day, and was one of those hot, unbearably humid, breathless evenings. I had stripped down to underwear and was lying flat out on the bed, too tired to eat. The doorbell rang. I threw on a shapeless dress and headed down the three narrow flights. At the bottom was a stranger with a brush cut in a short-sleeved madras shirt. When I learned that this was Larry, I was so disappointed; he looked utterly square. But I didn’t have a choice. I invited him in.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>It didn’t take long to learn that despite having cleaned up his appearance to immigrate to Canada, he was anything but boring and conventional. We spent most of that night walking the cooling streets, and talking, talking, talking. He was much better read than I, could recite Pound by heart. He knew about a whole group of West Coast poets I had never heard of: Lew Welch, Jack Spicer, Weldon Kees. Listening to him was like an enchantment. That connection through poets and poetry had begun and remained a constant thread in the years that followed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Larry went to Montreal and secured a job teaching high-school English in Saskatchewan; a few weeks later I took the train to Montreal and hitchhiked across Canada with him. I left him in Regina and flew to Berkeley to visit my roommate who was starting grad school there. It was 1968. <em>A lot</em> was happening outside of school. I came back for the fall semester of my junior year, but Harvard had lost its luster. What was I doing in gray winter classrooms, when life was churning outside? At the end of Fall term I decided to take a leave of absence (which I’m still on) and joined Larry in Canada.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Both Larry and I wrote daily, and for the first years of our time together we had the dream of making a living through writing. Of course, while writing, we had a series of other jobs, along with four children. Until 1974 Larry was a Federal fugitive, and though we came back to the US after he got his Canadian citizenship, he was swept up in a routine traffic stop right before the amnesty and taken to the stockade at Fort Ord. We had two toddlers and a baby at that time, and it was a dark period. But with help from family&mdash;and a lawyer&mdash;we managed to secure Larry’s release after six weeks. It helped that the mood of the country had swung against the war.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Those years living outside the law shaped our lives. Neither of us held a corporate or academic job. With unstable work and a growing family, poetry was last on the list&mdash;and it was a long list. I was focused on learning to do “real” things: raise farm animals, solder a pipe, change spark plugs. Looking back, I think those years, when we were scrambling to make ends meet, hungry for authenticity and purpose, were the perfect way to spend our twenties and early thirties. Those were years when many of our peers were embroiled in protest, a loose but sustaining community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Not that there weren’t difficult times both between us and between us and the world. We moved 17 times in those first 10 years, and being broke is exhausting. I often thought of Albee’s line from <em>Zoo Story</em>, “Sometimes it’s necessary to go a long distance out of the way to come back a short distance correctly.”</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>During that time I had nothing like a poetry community, and most of the poems I came across didn’t interest me. Perhaps I wrote a poem or two a year through the ‘70s and early ‘80s. Larry shifted from writing to publishing, and started <em>hit & run press</em> in 1974, which focuses on poetry books and broadsides&mdash;a hobby, never a job. In 1979 we moved to the Bay Area, and I stumbled into work as a technical writer and trainer. By 1983, I’d started TechProse, and Larry and I worked in it together once it became a real business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>In the mid-80s we discovered <em>This Way to the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen</em>, an amazing book about the Nazi camps by Tadeusz Borowski&mdash;a concentration camp survivor who wrote poems while in Birkenau and Dachau. Larry found a volume of Borowski’s poems in Polish at the UC Library. They had never been translated into English. I could read enough Polish to tell they were intriguing. Larry and I worked together with a native Polish speaker, Tadeusz Pioro, to translate a selection of these poems. Tad recorded the poems in Polish so we could listen to the originals, and he gave us literal translations. Then each of the three of us would write a version. We came together once a week to draft a unified translation. After several years of this, Larry published the final drafts in a volume that remains the only English version of Borowski’s poems, with an introduction by Stanisław Barańczak.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>When I complained to Tad that I hadn’t seen any contemporary poetry that moved me, he loaned me his copy of Sharon Olds’s <em>The Gold Cell.</em> I was blown away by the frank lyricism and specific detail of her writing. When I happened to see an ad in<em> PoetryFlash </em>that mentioned Sharon Olds was teaching a workshop, I applied and was accepted. As usual, I hadn’t read the fine print. I thought we were going to talk about poetry.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>When I arrived that first Saturday and went down to dinner, I was met by the imposing, glamorous Galway Kinnell, who announced that we were each going to write a poem that evening, and turn it in by 7:30 in the morning to discuss at morning sessions the next day, and that we’d be doing this every day for a week. I was terrified.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>But I found that all the poems that had been buried under the demands of work and children were still there. I wrote each day and managed to keep writing&mdash;not daily, but often&mdash;when I got home. This workshop became my poetry home. I returned a number of times as I wrote the poems that turned into my first book, <em>Jade Suit</em>, which Larry published in 2001.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>I often think back to how upset my parents were when I dropped out of school to live with a bearded, unemployed, non-Jewish deserter from the US Army and decided to get pregnant. How I wish they had lived just a little longer to see how it all turned out. Any long relationship has its snags and rents, but I can’t think of anyone else I would have wanted to spend my life with. In my new book, <em>Catwalk</em>, there are a lot of love poems, the hardest to write without being sentimental or clichéd. Here is one I wrote in Galway’s last workshop at Community of Writers:</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<blockquote><em>Gemstone<br><br>Years of drips in just one spot<br></em><em>scar the worn enamel of the sink<br></em><em>one drip at a time<br></em><em>until the powdered glass unfuses its mineral<br></em><em>bond, laying bare the iron underneath,<br></em><em>one black star of use.<br></em><em>So, after forty years your essence<br></em><em>reveals itself: familiar, flawed,<br></em><em>hardened by wear&mdash;the one I fell for<br></em><em>before I knew anything, glove</em><em><br></em><em>to my hand, derringer in my pocket,<br></em><em></em><em>sand in my oyster, four decades<br>polished to pearl.</em></blockquote>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Larry is always my first and often most critical reader. A few summers ago, I wrote a poem called \"Zucchini Ode,\" about the way, if you are a new gardener, you inevitably plant too many and are overwhelmed by zucchini. They grow faster than you can imagine what to do with them, you can’t give them away, people start avoiding you, etc. It was shaped into two overflowing triangles. I thought it worked and brought it up to read to Larry.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>When I was done, he looked despondent.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>“What?” I asked.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>“I thought you said ‘Bikini Ode.’ ” Oh. So I wrote this haiku for him:</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<blockquote><em>How artfully it</em>&nbsp;<br><em>draws the eye to just those parts&nbsp;</em><em><br></em><em>it’s meant to hide.</em></blockquote>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Only the haiku made it into <em>Catwalk</em>.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>While I have not had the traditional path to a poetic life, or ever discovered that career called “poet,” poetry has been and remains a sustaining force for me and the central theme of my lifelong love affair with the man who wrote that first fan letter.&nbsp;</p>",

		"body" : "<p>Moving through my childhood is noticeably different the second time around. Outside, summer is in full swing as usual: the Texas heat swells, cicadas emerge from the woods, wildflowers open their golden petals. At the same time, cities shut down, remaining under lockdown, and I am 22 and home again.<br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>For <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/07/pandemic-young-adults-living-with-parents/613723/\">millions</a> of young adults, coronavirus has meant moving out of apartments and college dorms and retreating to hometowns to quarantine indefinitely. There, we’ve resumed lives we thought we’d outgrown.&nbsp;<br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>This lull in time has proven disorienting. We have strict markers and phases in life. We believe time is linear. One period ends and another begins. Rarely, if ever, do we go back to a previous phase of life under normal circumstances. But now, suddenly, we find ourselves going in reverse.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Before the pandemic, I had grown used to independence. I’d recently graduated college; a fellowship abroad and a world of self-discovery lay ahead. I both braced myself for and looked forward to the uncertainty and potentiality of navigating my twenties.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>The past few months have felt like returning to an earlier, perhaps simpler, time: for the first time in years, my nuclear family is back together&mdash;my dad, my mom, my older sister. We all share the kitchen, the same restrooms. My sister’s hair clogs shower drains; my mother chastises me for not making my bed. During Christmas breaks our arrangements were temporary, but now, our lives merge into one another, like when my sister and I were kids.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>My bedroom is still pale blue, my shelves filled with Pokemon cards, sci-fi novels, and Bible camp t-shirts. My bed looks the same, too: navy sheets, a twin-sized bed lined with stuffed animals. Everything is familiar, almost nostalgic&mdash;the glow-in-the-dark stars, the planets hanging from the ceiling&mdash;but they feel like they belong to some former version of myself. If I close my eyes in this room, I could still be thirteen, adulthood a false memory.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Recently, I’ve realized that I spent twenty-two years growing up in my hometown and never fully noticed it. I spent each year here, took each step, looking towards the future, reaching for independence, fantasizing about leaving this blue town and escaping to the coast. And I realized, only too late, that I had rushed through the present, never thinking about the relationships I had to others, to this place.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>The interesting thing about this pandemic is the way it shapes time: not only does time reverse, but it slows. Some have called it a \"<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/15/857247844/the-pandemic-time-warp\">pandemic time warp</a>,\" a \"<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/coronavirus-time-warp-what-day-is-it/\">quarantine paradox</a>.” These days, time merges into itself, like a slippery dream, a sleepy giant, lethargic and lumbering on; days bleed together. They feel unreal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>With this abundant time, I see my hometown with more granularity, as if everything has more texture. I used to hate Texas, its identical suburbs and searing heat, and I looked forward to moving to a city. I despised the megachurches, my journals overflowing with angsty entries, whose author was dying to get out of this “hellhole.” Now, I still don’t love all aspects of Flower Mound (its homogeneity and overwhelming conservatism, most notably), but I notice more things, acknowledge the merits of this&nbsp;town&mdash;its open skies, the silhouette of my elementary school against the dusk.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>My relationships have gained depth, too, as the pandemic has forced us to slow down. We have family dinners now; I’m not running off to study for midterms. My sister and I took up gardening. Last week, we ordered gravel, pots, and plants. We painted animals on terracotta pots and decorated all the windowsills of our home, filling blank ledges with green succulents and African violets. By the time we were done, the windows were flushed with color and our jeans stained with soil.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>The experience is almost like correcting the past, having the chance to go back and redo. When you live things the second time around, you can tend to relationships, observe them more closely. The Google calendar and phone reminders feel less pressing. I soak in the stillness, feel time pass less urgently.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>This blip in time might help some make peace; for others it may heighten past traumas. For me, it seems a rare chance to re-examine priorities. In a few months, if we’re lucky, we’ll all separate again. My sister and I will leave our parents, my high school friends will excitedly scatter to graduate schools or jobs somewhere else, and in one another’s lives, we’ll fade into the backdrop of text messages and Facebook posts. For now, though, our lives remain intertwined in the distances among shared bathrooms, dinner tables, and childhood bedrooms.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>A few weeks ago, I met up with some high school friends to see the NEOWISE comet, which will not pass Earth again for millennia. The four of us brought masks, binoculars, and a compass, and turned off all the lights at a friend’s house.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>I can’t remember the last time I looked at the sky for so long. There’s too much light pollution in cities, and time felt too precious to spend looking up. But in this new world, there was nothing more pressing to do than sit in the backyard and look at stars, just me and my friends, in our painfully average suburb. We discovered constellations and talked about growing up in this town: all its winding roads, the mom-and-pop restaurants, the woods and the creeks. Once again, we were children, lying next to each other on the porch, stargazing. And it felt like a happy summation of everything: a new time, yet a reminder of my old life. Nowhere in our thoughts were viruses, parents, or the longing to be somewhere else.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>For now, it’s an eye-opening view from the bottom: for better or worse, a reminder of the way things once were.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

		"body" : "<p><em></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>The First Time</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>We are climbing up through the dense grassy underbrush. I am in shorts, and long blades keep scratching at my ankles like tiny reminders. I bat away bugs from my face and try to keep up with your infinitely long strides. You are in sneakers and you are unruffled. We climb up, and up, and up. I walk behind you, because I have never been where you are taking us. I am panting slightly, but I do not allow the air to make noise when it escapes my body. American Boys do not pant, so I must not either.</p>\r\n<p>We arrive at a ladder, but it is blocked off. A cold vertical sheet of metal hides the bottom half of its many rungs. The message here is clear&mdash;do not proceed, do not keep climbing, do not grip the cold metal deterrent and use it to effortlessly hoist yourself up the ladder’s sides, do not lift your endlessly tall body above and beyond its rungs. Yet you do, of course, as if you were placed on this earth solely to traverse smoothly and silently from one plane to the next.<br></p>\r\n<p>I am still on the ground.&nbsp;<br></p>\r\n<p>“Come on.”<br></p>\r\n<p>American Boys do not shirk from uninviting ladders, so I must not either. I gracelessly ascend, clanking and clambering my short wideness to the top in your wake. I reach the top&mdash;a quiet flash of pride from me, a silent nod from you. On the roof, a field of solar panels greet us, diagonal panes organized in meticulous rows that jut out from the flat roof.&nbsp;<br></p>\r\n<p>There are two American girls up here, whom you happen to know, of course, because you are an American Boy and you know everyone. They smile and wave and you chat with them. I smile and wave, too, but I remain a few steps away. They are smoking, carelessly, brazenly, and a few minutes later, so are we, on top of this roof as if we were always supposed to be here and the world was waiting for us to climb that blocked-off ladder and claim our territory this warm summer evening.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We inhale, we exhale, we taste the smell and smell the taste. I look up at you&mdash;always <em>up</em> at you&mdash;and for a second, I forget myself. I love this feeling, this unapologetic feeling of freedom, of control, the feeling of life itself. A flash of envy runs through me, for I can already tell that I will only ever have this feeling when I am with you, American Boy, for you are the living and breathing embodiment of what I so desperately wish to attain.</p>\r\n<p>We descend the ladder; you, perfectly, but when I do it I am clumsy. I make noise on my way down&mdash;a lot of noise, too much noise for this stealthy endeavor. A HUPD officer materializes from the air in front of us. I am scared, but I do not show it because American Boys are never scared. The officer asks us for our IDs, but just as quickly changes his mind, waving off our transgression as unworthy of his time and effort. “How’d you get up there?” he muses, irritated and befuddled. You tell him. I stand slightly behind you, and I say nothing. He sighs, wearily, and sends us on our way. If I were by myself, I know he would not have let me go so easily. I am glad to have you by my side, American Boy.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>The Best Time</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>On this spring afternoon I see cherry blossoms everywhere. There are especially many today, as if Mother Gaia personally erupted extra trees from the dirt, chock-full of flowers just for us to admire and adorn ourselves with on our journey. You jam the flowers in the hinges of your glasses, I gently tuck them behind my ears. Both the color and the feeling of the day are pink. There is nothing but lightness; I am happy and confident and unabashed as we walk down the streets blasting our music, laughing as loudly and full-bellied-ly as we want.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Today, I feel like an American Boy, and I am impenetrable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We find a shiny red car bumper abandoned on the street and we gravitate to it like crows. You pick it up, and we take turns hoisting it above our heads as the day’s trophy. We carry it with us until we grow tired of the load and then we lovingly re-abandon it in a grassy ditch.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We walk in this pink day for hours, years, millennia, eons, yet before I know it we hear music and voices drifting towards us. We see jubilant bodies running around in the grass, we see a stage and trailers and we know we are here.</p>\r\n<p>“Let’s scout out the area.”</p>\r\n<p>I follow you as we circle the scene like vultures hungry for a drop of life. Today’s activity is right up your alley, American Boy, because you’ve snuck into music festivals before, and completely out of mine, because I never have. But today is so beautiful that I don’t even think of you as an American Boy. I can only see and smell and taste and hear and feel pink all around us, and that which is not pink fades away and ceases to exist&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>Police cars drive up and down the road as you search for the best place to enter the festival.</p>\r\n<p>“Here.”</p>\r\n<p>It is comical for us to be sneaking through the bushes, bending our backs and creeping under the tree branches that are determined to thwart us on this pinkest of days. If I had known we would be creeping and crouching in the dirt, I would have worn brown or green or black, but we are both wearing brightly colored festival outfits as we try to make our way through this earthy obstacle course.</p>\r\n<p>We emerge into a grassy area and follow the blades towards the sounds of crowds and music.&nbsp;Then, instantly, standing between us and the festival is a police officer. He looks amused to see us. Again, you handle the talking, your voice a perfect mixture of self-assuredness with a tinge of sheepishness. You know how to command respect at all times, American Boy, even when you are a transgressor being confronted by a punisher. You are now laughing and chatting with the officer. He tells us that the festival is swarming with police so we may as well give up, and that the artist we undertook this day-long pilgrimage to see has already played her set, anyways. He lets us go, even wishing us well on our next journey of the day. I am sure he would not have been so jovial towards me if I had not had you by my side. It seems you are both my friend and my talisman, American Boy.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Every Time</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>We fill our days like this&mdash;you striding confidently ahead, me half a pace behind with half the amount of confidence you hold. We do what we want, where and when we want to. Anyone who tries to thwart us is no match for your American Boyhood. I learn all about how glorious it is to be an American Boy and to live unhindered and unafraid. But there is always a nagging in the furthest recess of my heart that reminds me that I will never be like you. My skin will not allow me, my body will not allow me, my hair will not allow me, nothing about me permits me to experience life the way you do. Some days I wish I could trade places with you, but those days are few and far between because I know that being an American Boy means being as light as air. And though ignorance is bliss, I know no amount of bliss is worth the weight of the world I put on my shoulders before wearing my backpack every morning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Some days, many days, most days, every day, it is hard to be your friend, but I fight through those days with all that I have because love is supposed to conquer all and I do not want this world to conquer ours.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>The Worst Time&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>During quarantine, I never hear from you. You hear from me, though.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>“Thanks for calling,” you say. “It’s good to hear your voice. I miss you. I love you.”</p>\r\n<p>At first, these words make me smile, because who doesn’t want to be loved by an American Boy?</p>\r\n<p>But then I realize&mdash;you hear from me.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>I never hear from you.</em></p>\r\n<p>And then come the murders.</p>\r\n<p>They were always there, but now, while we are all confined in our homes to our screens, they reverberate louder than ever.</p>\r\n<p>They come hard and heavy and fast and endless and somehow each one hurts as much as, if not more than, the first.</p>\r\n<p>Each reminds me that I am not wanted, I am not seen, I am not loved,</p>\r\n<p>And that the American Self does not recognize the American Others.</p>\r\n<p>I cry every day until I decide it’s time to stop crying and get to work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I organize and I educate and I teach and I share and I protest and I mourn and I grieve and I shout into the void and I decide that I will never stop.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And then I beg, I beg, I beg.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I beg the American Boys and the American Girls whom I think that I love to let me know they are here. I beg them to let me know that all the differences in the world cannot tear us apart. It is a futile, pitiful task, but one I engage in nevertheless in a desperate bid to bring me temporary comfort.</p>\r\n<p>Their words come, like Band-Aids on bullet holes&mdash;ineffective, but marginally better than nothing.</p>\r\n<p>There is one person that never offers a Band-Aid. It is you, American Boy, and yours was the only Band-Aid I ever really wanted.</p>\r\n<p>You stop hearing from me. I continue not hearing from you. Silence begets silence begets silence that I, of course, have to be the one to break, because you don’t even realize that it’s there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We’ve had this conversation many times before, but I know in my aching bones that this time will be different.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This time will be the last time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I cry when I realize that all along you showed me the truth; that you are an American Boy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You could never preoccupy yourself with my pain and sully your American Boyhood with my lack thereof. You could never stain your pale American skin with the dark shades of my Otherness.</p>\r\n<p>I cry when I realize I always knew this, but I hung on anyway because I wanted to be like you&mdash;lighter than a gust of air, heavier than the force of law.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ignorance was bliss, but now it is our downfall, American Boy.</p>\r\n<p>I tell you that I need more, that I am tired of the Sisyphean task of pushing our relationship up a doomed hill. You say you try to do your best, but you know that it's not enough.</p>\r\n<p><em>Then fight for me</em>, I scream inside my brain. <em>Fight the way I do.</em></p>\r\n<p>I do not vocalize these words because thinking them is pain enough and I do not need the inevitable excuses you will come up with as to why you will never fight like I do, or half as much or a tenth as much or an iota as much as I do.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I do not vocalize these words because I see you, American Boy, and I know who you are. I always have.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I know it is time and I let go.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>I remember the pink days, the days where each breath felt exalted, where each ray of light that touched our skin felt like it was sent from the heavens just to kiss our bodies.<br></p>\r\n<p>But when pink turns to black and red, American Boys are nowhere to be found.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/p0E6Rq8Jq-I7-tV0Jqv4DSHTw6NyIqYoxfSxrzzpwUwF6pEkC0M79beQZ3z5RtESy1cS3ERhfDARbPu3SltfU_Z7u1uQFgsJzP03-i-XUG0iNCNdWh4SRbYtiCwyowJ09eqFS6dy\" width=\"549\" height=\"411\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></p>\r\n<figcaption>Graphic by Juliet Nwagu Ume-Ezeoke</figcaption>",

		"slug" : "NotEvenThat",
		"body" : "<p>As part of a recent slate of classwork, I read Joseph Beam’s 1991 <em>Brother to Brother: Words from the Heart. </em>Beam (1954-1988) was an African-American writer, poet, and activist who wrote extensively about the difficulties he faced being a Black gay man in America during the AIDS epidemic. In <em>Brother to Brother, </em>Beam discusses what it is like to be a Black gay man, and expresses the desire for a future where Black masculinity can be reconstructed to allow for Black men to share emotional intimacy and vulnerability with one another.&nbsp;<br></p>\r\n<p>What interested me most about Beam’s work were his explorations of the erasure he felt in America as a Black gay man. I was particularly struck by the image of glass, which appears when Beam describes a man who stopped acknowledging him in public upon realizing Beam’s sexual identity: &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>“He no longer speaks, instead looks disdainfully through me as if I were glass. But glass reflects, so I am not even that. He sees no part of himself in me...I do not expect his approval&mdash;only his acknowledgement.”&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Though Beam and I exist in different identities and contexts, the continuing relevance of this quote instantly resonated with me as a Black woman who strives to claim subjecthood in American society, which loves to objectify.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/x-MZRuSrz2Vx2iOnBPhPB_DX63aVRnbKNaHluLUtC6BLWWsg6NQ0tDSOuofmRNc2_uXCdTEwDyHWmMYepcY1saD8z_6Ylh_71FDS-Qq9gjtwu3RIRaacR7A1SdmmLPi-S7vrhZsQ\" width=\"140\" height=\"424\"><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Not Even That</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em><br></em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>what does it mean to be made of glass?</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em><br></em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>shining</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>A web that catches Sun’s rays,</p>\r\n<p>stained stained by the very the light it holds,&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>forged by heat and passion and force followed by</p>\r\n<p>a soft cooling.</p>\r\n<p>Allowing glimmers and prisms entry into the home,</p>\r\n<p><em>The House which neglects it, which lets it grow dusty and streaked</em></p>\r\n<p><em>The House which takes it for granted,&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p><em>The House which only recognizes The Sun</em></p>\r\n<p><em>The House which thinks the Sun exists solely to shine upon</em></p>\r\n<p><em>It</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em><br></em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>fragile</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Smoothness slips through skin,</p>\r\n<p>shatters seamlessly on a stark stagnant surface.</p>\r\n<p><em>Who in America hasn’t broken glass before?</em></p>\r\n<p>Gunshots streak through the sky &mdash; spontaneously splintering.</p>\r\n<p><em>They say it is bad luck to break a mirror &mdash; seven years worth of it</em></p>\r\n<p><em>they say to break a mirror splits the soul into shards</em></p>\r\n<p><em>and leaves its owner&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p><em>unprotected</em></p>\r\n<p><em>from karmic retribution.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em><br></em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>reflective</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Passing a storefront window</p>\r\n<p>Delaying, looking, examining, thinking, adjusting</p>\r\n<p><em>Lest he forgets that he is human</em></p>\r\n<p>Passing a glass person</p>\r\n<p>Speeding up, averting, ignoring, denying, unchanging</p>\r\n<p><em>Lest the cast-back image reveal an unattractive truth</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em><br></em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>transparent</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Dark and translucent transgressions of nature,</p>\r\n<p>transported at a moment’s notice from here to beyond,</p>\r\n<p>transformed from breathing beings to bloodless bones.</p>\r\n<p><em>What has transpired to make you so transitory?</em></p>\r\n<p><em>In order to transcend,</em></p>\r\n<p><em>They say you must transfuse.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em><br></em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>what does it mean to be not even that?</em></strong></p><p><br><strong></strong></p>",

Now I know what it is like to be moored on a deserted island, alone under the violent sun.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>My island is not made of hard earth or sediment; it is soft and made of gray woven cotton. When I cast my gaze around me, no blue waves roll and thrash; my island and I are buoyed by layers of dirt and grass. On this island, I do not fear wild creatures in the night; in their place, I am pestered by persistent mosquitoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All around me, I see people running, kicking balls into goals, sitting in the sunshine, walking dogs. Many of the families around me have their own cotton islands too, some patterned, some plain, which they lay out on the grass and eat sandwiches upon. I see all of them from my gray cotton island, and of course, I see your little island as well. Yours is technically two islands put together to create one multi-patterned cotton patch, laid out meticulously on a square of grass six feet away from mine with nothing and everything hovering in the space between us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I suppose if I were truly alone on some unlucky island in the middle of some unfortunate ocean, I would spend my days staring at the waves, surrounded by lifeless survival tools, attempting in vain to conjure up sensations of other human beings&mdash;of seeing them, tasting them, holding them, feeling their soft pulses against my skin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Here on our cotton islands, I don’t have to struggle in vain to visualize other people, to visualize <em>you</em>, but I do have to undertake the formidable task of imagining what your skin feels like against mine. We never touched before the island days and now it is too late.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One day, and one day only, we break the rolling waves of grass between us&mdash;hands extend, first furtively, then fiercely. In those gentle moments of intertwinement, we are no longer on islands, we are steady on the mainland with not a drop of ocean in sight. The smell of saltwater dissipates, the cawing gulls melt into nothingness, and for one short time that stretches easily into eons, I finally get to experience the feelings that I fruitlessly tried to imagine before this moment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At this moment, which ends all too quickly, I realize I would not want a compass or a knife to keep me safe on a desert island. I would simply want your hand to hold.</p>",

At the age of six, Chang started lessons at the Juilliard School, from when the title of ‘child prodigy’ followed her to her debut with the New York Philharmonic at age eight and her first album recording, <em>Debut</em>, at age ten.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Unlike many other child prodigies who tend to grow out of music, Chang sailed through that “confusing” phase of her life, finding value in music beyond the ritzy stage: she delivered handcrafted violins to children in impoverished and war-torn regions as America’s cultural ambassador, proudly bore New York’s 2004 Olympic torch, and travelled to one of the most secluded places in the world&mdash;Pyongyang, North Korea&mdash;for a concert aimed at peace and reunification. It was this last experience that taught her that living as a musician is far more than “just jetting around the world and playing concerts.”&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Dialing in from suburban Philadelphia with her dog Chewie barking in the background, Sarah Chang talked about her most memorable concert venues and repertoire, her philosophy of interpreting classical music, the difficulties that come with her overwhelming travel schedule, and the venerable allure of her three-hundred-year-old violin.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>What got you started as a violinist?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Being stereotypical Asian parents, my parents stuck me on a piano when I was about three. They made me go to piano lessons, swim lessons, ballet lessons, tennis lessons&mdash;almost everything. But when I turned four, I was the one who asked for the violin instead. The piano is a great introductory instrument, but I didn’t like the fact that it wasn’t my own. If I’d practiced on one piano at home, I’d play on a different piano for a lesson. Then if I had to perform somewhere else, there was, yet again, a different piano. I wanted an instrument that I could own.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>What has changed in your approach to music since you started?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>When I was young, I was very bright-eyed, and everything was new and exciting. When I debuted at Carnegie Hall and played in Berlin and London, I wasn’t really thinking, “What is the impact that this concert will have on my musical journey, and what am I bringing to the audience?” As I grew older, however, playing the violin became gratifying on a musical level. Experiencing life through my own eyes, every concerto becomes about not only note delivery, but delivering my own story behind what the composer asked for, and on top of that, adding my own style and telling the story through my own voice.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>I was in my late teens&mdash;maybe 20s&mdash;when I realized that violin is more than just performing in a city and jetting off to the next venue. The first time I realized that was when I went to North Korea for a concert in Pyongyang, a place that’s still on shaky political grounds. One hundred musicians from South Korea’s KBS orchestra flew over and joined hands with Pyongyang’s own orchestra. The whole idea was for the two Koreas to stand unified on one stage. The event was so much more than just another concert. It was highly political, since it sent a strong message to the rest of the world that music can be used as a multifaceted tool for bringing people together. I think politicians and lawmakers utilize classical music as sort of a gentle, softer approach to get talks started again. That’s what kickstarted my interest in doing more than just jetting around the world and playing concerts.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Any memorable experiences from your travels?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>When it comes to concerts, it’s about being in a beautiful hall with my musical colleagues. Standing in the acoustics of New York’s Carnegie Hall, Berlin, or Vienna, for instance, is always special. Boston City Hall is one of my favorite halls, if not my favorite hall in the entire US. There are certain places that really stand out as jewels when it comes to concert venues.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When it comes to my outreach as the United States’ artistic ambassador, visiting Ukraine hit me hard because I was there right after the attack at St. Michael’s Square. I went back two years later, and they had completely recovered. As part of outreach, I try to travel around the world and work with kids&mdash;not just the really talented students who are already in the academy with a promising future&mdash;but those who have experienced war or whose towns have been completely decimated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I went to villages in Africa where I’d bring children instruments. Some of the kids, I realized, were walking to school at 6am because they couldn’t bring their instruments back home for fear of being robbed. They would come to practice early in the morning at school without sheet music, learning the pieces by ear. Seeing something so real and raw humbled and encouraged me to do more for the global community.&nbsp; It was truly so much more rewarding than doing my 10,000th concert. The easy thing that I have been doing for years and years is just doing the contract. But after a while, that becomes self-serving and sort of one-dimensional. Music really has so much more meaning now.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>What was it like to work with many different conductors and orchestras?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>I view the conductor as someone who can bring a great performance to a magical level. With the right conductor, with the right chemistry, with the right sort of partnership, orchestras can bring what is already a great performance to a once-a-year magical moment&mdash;where the concert stays in your soul and brings you back to it even after years and years have passed.</p>\r\n<p>Conducting is more than carrying technique with the baton&mdash;providing the downbeat and a handful of important cues in the middle. Rather, conducting is about creating atmosphere and emotional storytelling. A great conductor brings the piece alive with a vision and a fresh interpretation. Frankly, considering the level of orchestras that I typically work with, the musicians know the repertoire inside out and can play it in their sleep. They could play on their own without a conductor and still deliver a first-class performance. But I tend to liken the conductor to a great football coach. For instance, the Patriots are always going to play great, right? But with the right coach, their games really stand out.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>As a soloist, spatially, I’m always facing the audience. A hundred musicians are behind me and they cannot see my face, which means that the conductor and the baton is all the more important: we have to breathe and move as one with all the cues and all the nuances.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Any memorable rehearsal moments you’ve had?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Many times. There was this one time when I only had one dress rehearsal on the day of the show. I was flying in that day and the flight was delayed, so we had a 10 minute rehearsal right before the concert. That was a nerve-wracking experience. There’s never enough time for necessary rehearsals. My other memorable moments are when the conductors would get up, leave the baton, and start singing what they want. It’s so much more demonstrative and effective than trying to follow the beat. It’s great when they show by example.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>What for you is the main difference between playing live and playing in a studio?</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Recording studios mean that volume is not an issue because you have a mic attached to you. In a concert hall, your sound has to carry through. I love having an audience, feeling their energy, and playing off the electricity I feel in larger music halls. In a recording studio, I don’t have any of that. Instead, I’m playing in an empty room for sound control with only a producer and a sound engineer. There’s a unique adrenaline kick I get from being on stage with an audience, which is really hard to replicate in the studios.</p>\r\n<p>This was part of the reason why so many of my records were actually done in a live concert atmosphere. For my discography, especially a lot of the later ones&mdash;for instance, Sibelius, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Lalo&mdash;I started asking for live recordings. It’s a lot riskier, but you automatically have an audience in front of you.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>When I started, my very first recording came out on a cassette tape. Now nobody’s even with CDs anymore, since everything is downloaded. Music is a lot more accessible, which is great. But on the downside there are people who, instead of being focused on the concert, stick up their iPad interface and just try to record the whole thing.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Tell me more about how you walk through and interpret different classical pieces.</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>When it comes to the classical composers from the Bach or Beethoven era, the composers basically wrote down everything they had wanted. There’s not much that you need to do except honoring what the composer asked for. But when you get to the Romantic and the contemporary periods&mdash;by that I mean anything from Tchaikovsky to Sibelius&mdash;you have more license and freedom to put your own personal stamp on things. It’s fun but you also have more responsibility because you’re given more leeway. It depends on how you see yourself: as a storyteller with a distinct voice versus as a messenger of the composer. Throughout the years, I’ve altered my view, where now I feel that my job is more to bring the composer’s wishes to light, portraying their vision as honestly as I can.</p>\r\n<p>There are times when you read back into the composers’ biographies and you realize, “Oh, they were not good human beings.” There are times when you idolize somebody so much in your head because you admire their work and their compositions, but then you read into their life history and you’re really disappointed. Nevertheless, as soloists, we have to take that as a whole and try to give the most beautiful version of the piece possible.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>What would you say is your personal signature as an artist?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>My strength is centered around the Romantic era. It’s what I grew up with and it’s where I feel the most at home. The Romantic era has a lot of technical stuff, but at the end of the day, it’s unapologetically beautiful writing. I love the Sibelius Concerto [in D minor]. The Brahms Concerto and Shostakovich’s First Concerto are masterpieces that are personal to me. There are other personal favorites&mdash;for instance, Swan Lake and Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>Another part of my signature is that I have a phenomenal instrument. I have a 1717 Guarneri del Gesu which I purchased from Isaac Stern before he passed away, and I am very fortunate to have it. Its lower two strings&mdash;the G and the D&mdash;are dark, powerful, almost rumbling. The upper two strings&mdash;the A and the E strings&mdash;have a soprano, a sweet, almost Strad-like sound. It took me a while to learn what it could and could not do for me, but it really is my voice on stage. I am incredibly appreciative that I have an instrument that is able to cut through big halls and a 100-musician orchestra as needed. I love the balance that the instrument has.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>What are some of the highs and lows of being a classical musician?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>The best part is that I’m always learning. Even if I’ve played concertos a thousand times in the past, I’m always discovering new nuances and dynamics to the pieces. I recently played Vivaldi’s “Four Seasons” with an orchestra in Cremona, Italy, where the music originated. The musicians there barely used sheet music, since Vivaldi is their bread and butter. They played parts that were highly unusual, which would ordinarily make someone raise an eyebrow and say, “That’s not written, what are you doing?” But they brought so much freshness to the piece. It made me respect the fact that the music was written 400 years ago, and yet, here I am, playing the piece I’ve played for decades, but I’m still learning new, eye-opening tweaks and phrases.</p>\r\n<p>The downside is the endless travel. Your body is perpetually tired. The one solid, consistent thing that I always do before a concert is take a nap backstage.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Who are your role models within and beyond the classical musical industry?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>David Oistrakh, when it comes to a musician, and Elizabeth Taylor, when it comes to a non-musician. I love the fact that the woman didn’t care what everyone&nbsp;else thought. I love that she made the movies she wanted, married who she wanted, wore the jewels she wanted without caring what anyone else thought. She lived. And I think that’s so awesome.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>What advice would you have given to your younger self?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>This will be the ride of your life. Be prepared to not be home a lot and miss out on a lot of life, but the happiness that you’ll get at the end will be worth it. The best piece of advice that I wish I had gotten that nobody gave me is that music is a business. I honestly thought it’s just about practicing and performing. But it’s not. It is running a small business of which the product is myself. You have a team of agents and managers and lawyers and assistants and record executives&mdash;all on this train of managing your career. Prepare yourself to realize that there is a lot of outside noise and a lot of stuff that has nothing to do with music at all. A concert does not just mean practicing on your own&mdash;it means fundraising events for the health of the orchestra, donor events, press events, interviews, appearances. There are things that you didn’t sign up for but are a part of the whole gig.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>What does classical music mean for you?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>What I really love about the classical music industry is that regardless of your age, gender, race, or nationality, if you play well, then that’s it. As long as you deliver on stage and you have substance, it’s very black and white. You either play well or you don’t. A lot of orchestras hold blind auditions so that the judges can’t see you. There’s a certain amount of fairness in that.</p>\r\n<p>I love Beyonce, I love Lady Gaga, and I go to a lot of pop concerts. I’m totally involved in the entertainment value of going to a pop concert where you have the lasers, the special effects, the dancers, the bands, the catchy music videos. I love all of that. But if I think back on all the concerts I’ve been to in my life, including the Beyonce and Bon Jovi concerts, the ones that have stirred something inside of me, touched my emotional core, and lasted in my soul were classical concerts. Classical music takes you back to an era that is pure and so honest. As classical musicians, we don’t lip sync. We don’t have fancy smoke machines. We’re delivering it live every single night. There’s something really beautiful about that. And optimistically speaking, I do believe in the fact that good, beautiful quality music will always be around.</p>",

		"title" : "An American Family: A Reflection on Minari",
		"slug" : "a-reflection-on-minari",
		"body" : "<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The film <em>Minari</em> follows the first-generation Korean-American Yi family as they move from California to rural Arkansas in the 1980s. The semi-autobiographical work by director Lee Isaac Chung captures a moment of both transition and displacement in the Yi’s lives as they attempt, in the face of numerous challenges, to take root in Arkansas.</p>\r\n<p><em>Minari </em>comes to streaming services at a time of increasing violence towards Asian Americans. In the weeks preceding the publication of this review, a shooter in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/us/asian-bias-atlanta-shooting.html\">Atlanta, Georgia targeted and killed a group of Asian American women</a>. In the past year, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/19/us/anti-asian-racism-pandemic.html\">horrific and violent hate crimes targeting Asian Americans have soared</a>, with Asian American advocacy groups estimating that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/us/hate-crimes-against-asian-americans-community.html\">over 3,700 attacks</a> have occurred.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Minari</em> is not a response to this. No single work could be expected to respond to the tangle of problems ranging from the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/us/racism-sexism-atlanta-spa-shooting.html\">hyper-sexualization of Asian American women</a> to the erasure of Asian-American narratives. But at the same time, <em>Minari</em> feels inextricable from the current climate: as a viewer and as a person, it is impossible not to ask the movie for wisdom in this time.</p>\r\n<p><em>Minari</em> grapples with identity by reflecting on the domestic. Monica and Jacob, the parents, struggle with their marriage, fighting over their fraught relationship to the American Dream. The two are homesick for Korea, but cannot give up their dream of a better life in America; the two have a stable life working as chicken sexers, but want a more fulfilling life. The paradoxes that the two are pulled between feel impossible. Jacob pursues his dream of owning a farm, despite the financial and physical risk. But Monica is concerned with safety above all else, especially for their son David, who suffers from a heart condition. She wants to continue their work as chicken sexers, in spite of the tedium and difficulty. Neither is right; neither is wrong.</p>\r\n<p>The difficulties the pair face are felt just as deeply by their children, David and Anne. While Monica and Jacob argue over the farm, the camera cuts to David and Anne. Huddled in a bedroom, they scribble “don’t fight” on pieces of paper, which they fold into paper planes and throw at their parents. Burdened by the tension in the household, David and Anne are forced to shoulder the weight of impossible decisions they are too young to understand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In <em>Minari, </em>identity is examined through a focus on family and interiority, but is contextualized in the Yi’s wider environment. When Monica struggles with her English, a group of women at church coo at her condescendingly; later, a young girl babbles at Anne and asks if it sounds like Korean. The Yis are not just in an unfamiliar place, they are being forced to see themselves as unfamiliar as well. A shot of David riding in a school bus surrounded by white children reminds us that even when race is not named, it is a factor in how the family must interact with the world, each other, and themselves.</p>\r\n<p>The cast of <em>Minari</em> is noticeably strong. Jacob, played by an effortlessly compelling Steven Yeun, is equally as expressive with his joy as he is with his anger. Monica, played by Yeri Han, is a more subtle character but no less charismatic. David, played by seven-year-old Alan Kim, is mischievous and charming. The grandmother, Soonja, played by Youn Yuh-jung, forms heartwarming, odd relationships with the rest of the family. The cast and their chemistry with one another bring the movie to life, vividly capturing moments of warmth and sorrow.</p>\r\n<p>As <em>Minari</em>’s storyline unfurls, conflict seems to never fully resolve &mdash; as one source of tension dissipates, another unexpectedly emerges. Chung seems to suggest that for the Yis, a sense of precarity is fundamental and inescapable, as it is for so many immigrant families. But Chung seems to have a warmer message for us as well. Soonja chases David through the house, bursting with laughter; Jacob swings David in the air after he helps him find water. There are moments of levity and warmth, too. Trauma and difficulty does not eclipse the life of this family: there is something more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><em>A24 at Harvard hosted a screening of the Golden-Globe-winning film Minari.

alt=\"AlexanderRosenbergHeadshot\" title=\"AlexanderRosenbergHeadshot\"></h1>\r\n<figcaption><em>Alexander Rosenberg</em></figcaption>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Alexander Rosenberg is a Philadelphia-based multimedia artist, educator, and writer who specializes in the study of glass. Like many, I first encountered his work through <em>Blown Away</em>, a Netflix reality TV series about competitive glassblowing that has taken off during the pandemic. After reaching third place in the first season of <em>Blown Away </em>with his inventive, precise, and delicate pieces, Rosenberg came back for season two as a guest judge. I sat down with him over Zoom to discuss his background, interests, and experiences with both glass and reality TV.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Talia Blatt: Let’s start with some background for people who may not be as familiar with you and your work. When and how did you get into glassblowing?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Alexander Rosenberg: It was really kind of an accident. I had some problems in high school, and I ended up living on the West Coast as a high school drop out. One of my roommates was taking glassblowing classes at a community college, and he was bringing home these primitive &mdash; I mean they were really awful &mdash; but just these globby looking things. And I think I knew that the stuff was bad, but I was so excited by the notion that this process &mdash; that I thought was very mechanical, or kind of industrial &mdash; could be done by a human hand. I was curious about it, so I went and took the class. I didn’t do well. I don’t even know if I passed the first time. But I took it a couple times, and then I ended up getting my high school diploma, I went back to the east coast to go to art school, and it turned out that there was a glass program there that I could major in. I still hadn’t really connected glass making to the types of art that I was interested in; I didn't really see glass as a medium for personal expression. But I went to the Rhode Island School of Design, and they had a glass program that was really unusual. It was almost like a multimedia-things-about-transparency program&mdash;they would call it a material-specific sculpture program. They had this really good lecture series, with all these avant-garde, multidisciplinary artists. And I started seeing in the periphery what the different students in that program were making, and it was really weird. It was a lot of performance; a lot of stuff with no glass in it; stuff with smoke, and bubbles, and shadows &mdash; and I wanted to work with those ephemeral types of materials. So I ended up sticking around.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>TB: The other way people know you is through the reality TV show </strong><strong><em>Blown Away</em></strong><strong>. Would you recommend the experience of being on reality TV?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>AR: It’s weird because the show has really allowed me to make a living in a way I wasn’t able to before. And I had no frame of reference for what kind of visibility a Netflix series would bring. So now it’s this weird, complicated situation, because I teach, and I’ll go give talks to students at different schools, and when people ask me advice about how to make a living as an artist, really the only advice I have is: Go on a reality television show, I guess? (Laughs).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>I also had no idea what glass as reality television would be like. I’m not really a fan of reality television, but I’ve seen <em>Project Runway</em>, which I like because it reminds me of art school. I was desperate when I applied to the show; I was looking for anything that would pay me to do what I know how to do, and I didn’t have many other prospects. I thought: Maybe it’s going to be awful, maybe they’re going to stick us in a house and try to cultivate some interpersonal drama. It turned out the people behind this production were nice and responsible and humane (laughs). I even asked the casting director, who I was becoming friends with, ‘Is it always like this?’ And she said, ‘No, this is just a very good group.’ So I was pleasantly surprised, because my expectations were so low.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>TB: It’s interesting that you describe watching the show as “not that stressful,” which I think is a good characterization, but not intuitive, given the inherent drama of the material. For example, I saw on your Twitter just last week that you had a glass-related eye injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>AR: Yeah, you can see my face still looks messed up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>TB: I guess I was wondering if you felt that injuries were priced into the art form. Why choose a medium that can be so painful?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>AR: So, I don’t usually get hurt. It was a bit of a freak incident. I am careful &mdash; I try to take good care of myself outside of the studio. It’s kind of boring &mdash; I try to exercise, so that my body feels okay. I don’t drink or do drugs, which is just because I’m sober. And I wear the proper safety equipment &mdash; the big shades, which are usually pretty effective. I’m left-eye dominant, which means my left eye can see form better than my other eye. So I have this very hunchy way I have to sit at the bench, and I was all hunched over, holding the tool in my hand. I slashed the side of my hand and I had this knee-jerk reaction to recoil, and I just mashed the safety glasses across the bridge of my nose. Split my face open, there was blood, the guys who were helping me were appalled, and I said, “We’re gonna finish this, keep working,” and then we did, and then I cleaned up. I’m sorry, that doesn’t answer your question. Why do I choose something that has this bit of a dangerous or painful element to it? A lot of people get attracted to a process that demands such attention and presence. Few things are like it. You can’t be checking your phone; you can’t be thinking about other stuff. It’s meditative in that respect. There’s this scholar-philosopher, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who writes about this state of flow. Do you know his work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>TB: Yeah, I’m familiar with the concept.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>AR: He has a book called <em>Flow.</em> Basically, he says people’s lives are better if they achieve this state a lot. And he says flow happens when the task that you're being asked to do demands all of your ability, but not beyond, and, in flow, you start to lose a sense of time, of being in your body. I think it’s a good description. I do other stuff that has a dangerous element, like I’m a hobby rock climber. It’s the same thing &mdash; when there is a little bit of a threat, there is a higher level of focus. And that is pleasant in some way .It offers relief from other aspects of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>TB: High risk, high reward?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>AR: High risk, high reward (laughs). That’s a good way to say it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>TB: The last question I’ll ask that relates to Twitter and pain &mdash; I promise: I saw that your profile picture on Twitter is a black and white photo of you being slapped in the face, and I was wondering if there was a backstory to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>AR: (laughs) It’s a still from a video that I made of nine people slapping me in the face. It’s shot with one of those high speed cameras. I really like misusing high tech equipment. That camera is able to capture really small and really fast movements, so that you could see the movement behind the movement, or the movement within the movement. And I wanted to take this gesture that might have been seen as violence &mdash; maybe in that context, it's kind of comical, it's a parody of violence &mdash; I wanted to slow it down and see if that would do something different. And it did. The slaps turned into caresses. Also, like with any other high speed photography, it required a lot of light, because the shutter is so quick. So I had to have my eyes closed, or I would be blinded by it. It has a really unusual quality to it, as a document of me. It reminds me of this Giuseppe Penone photograph called ‘To Reverse One's Eyes,’ where he wears these weird contacts and&nbsp; can't see, but you can see the rest of the room reflected in his eyes. So it's also this document of his youth. In that same way, I can't see, but it’s showing something about my interior to the rest of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>TB: That was a much better answer for that question than I anticipated &mdash; I thought it might be, ‘Yeah, my friend took the photo and I thought it was cool.’ Anyway, to talk more about your work, in their review of </strong><strong><em>Blown Away</em></strong><strong>, The New Yorker called you a minimalist, which I thought was a misnomer. But I think it was responding to your use of clear glass, when most of the other artists liked using color. Why the clear glass preference?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>AR:&nbsp; I agree with you. I thought that didn't seem to accurately describe what I was doing. Because I don't think clear glass is a minimal aesthetic. It's really quite complicated. There's a reflective quality to it, so you have every other thing going on in the space in it, and there's distortion and refraction. So it's changing the way that we see what’s beyond it. And from a formal perspective, I just have very little interest in surface and pattern, and I have much more interest in form, from making the glass. I would much rather have the complexity live in the actual form than in an illustration or something on the surface. I also think clear glass is really special. It's unusual for there to be a material or an object where you can see both the inside and the outside of it, simultaneously, or be able to see things like wall thickness, and almost experience a cutaway view of an object as it sits in real space before you. So, why wouldn’t I exploit those unique properties, instead of hiding them? It seems like an opportunity. All of the themes that I’m interested in, that I think are present in the material properties of glass, are related to clear glass. When you look at glass as a material that’s historically related to seeing the unseen; measuring, observing and encapsulating the natural world; anything that's really, really small or really, really far away; all the newest kinds of information technologies &mdash; all of these are through clear glass. So those being the kind of topics and technologies that I'm interested in, I'm going to use that same kind of material vernacular to talk about them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>TB: I think that speaks to something I’ve noticed in your work: an emphasis on functionality and utility. In the show, you made a lachrymatory viewer and a candelabra, for example. Do you ever feel that there's tension between making glass for its utility and making glass for some pure aesthetic purpose?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>AR: I don't know if I believe there's such a thing as a purely aesthetic experience. It reminds me a little bit of the kind of utopian dreams of modernity from the middle of the century &mdash; that there can be these objects that are so neutral that they are beyond class and race and sex. But that being said, I think from a methodological standpoint, I like using materials for what they already do. If I'm interested in these different disciplines, I want to use the material in the way that it is actually used in those disciplines. The kind of project-based work that I do is driven more by a theme or an interest, which is then answered by a particular process or a material. And clear glass then just works better for me in terms of communicating this and creating these empathetic experiences within the audience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>TB: Speaking of empathetic experiences, I was looking through your work on your website and I was particularly struck by </strong><a href=\"https://www.alexanderrosenberg.net/Lantern-Room\" target=\"_blank\"><em><u><strong>Lantern Room</strong></u></em></a><strong>&nbsp;&mdash; the sign in the window that beats in time with your heart. Why make something so intimate?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>AR: There were a few different things: First, I live in this neighborhood that was pretty edgy when I first moved here. Somebody did break into my house one time while I was sleeping, and I had to chase them down with a dog. But also I think a lot about public space. I like to work in the public, which isn't always easy to do in an official, sanctioned way. You can't always just say, ‘I want to put this thing in this park,’ and then do it. So I like to think about opportunities to use what I already have to do the projects that I want to do. And I wanted to do something that brought a little bit of light into this neighborhood that historically had a coal power plant, and when that was the source of a lot of power for this part of the city, there was light everywhere. And since it was abandoned, the neighborhood kind of fell behind. So I wanted to make something light, and then I just like this idea &mdash; it's like that Giuseppe Penone photo that I mentioned &mdash;&nbsp; this idea of taking something that's very private, something as interior as a process in somebody's body, and flipping it around, using this material to make it very public.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>I was having some health problems too, at that time, and I wanted to see if I could get my doctor to look at it from her house with a telescope, to check in. She thought it was a nice idea, but she couldn’t really see it from where she was. But I liked the idea of that. And the neighborhood started to learn how to use it. They mostly would use it to know if I was home or not. Maybe that’s the opposite of bringing safety (laughs). But people would notice. They'd be like, ‘Oh yeah, you were up late last night.’ And it seems a little bit creepy, but it's actually nice. It was this way to have closeness with people who wouldn't ordinarily be that close, a little piece of intimacy. And that's something I think appears across a lot of my work: looking for this connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>TB: I think another work of yours that also seems to speak to this idea of using public space is </strong><em><u><strong><a href=\"https://www.alexanderrosenberg.net/On-Exactitude-in-Tourism\" target=\"_blank\">On Exactitude in Tourism</a></strong></u></em><strong>, in which you wrote about being inspired by a Borges story. Do you find yourself regularly drawing from literature?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>AR: Yeah, that was one of the first projects that I made when I moved to Philadelphia. And it was driven by this desire to work in public in an unsanctioned way. And the Borges story was perfect because it’s about mapping. When you're new to a city and mapping it for yourself, you’re redoing work that's already been done. And I am always interested in having the ability to be lost in a place &mdash; this thing that happens when you're new to a place and you just don't know anything &mdash; and how quickly that fades, especially now with all of our technological tools, how rare it is to actually be lost. I love that story. I like storytelling. Even though I think my projects sometimes get a little bit abstract in their resolution, I do really love telling the story of a work. Especially before <em>Blown Away</em>, I would give a lot of artist talks, and I would tell the background of these different projects. And I liked to tell them in such a way that people could retell them. And one of the things that I like the most is when a story of a project gets retold to an audience that hasn't ever seen it. And sometimes, the story would even come back to me. And that's exciting to me. I like the way that these projects can live on in almost an oral tradition, like a spoken narrative.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>TB: The last question I'll ask about your style is I've noticed that in a lot of interviews of you, you’re identified as a ‘Jewish glass artist.’ I was wondering how you felt about that label, or if you thought there was anything inherently Jewish about your work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>AR: I'm reading that as something that just happens. The series was getting a lot of attention. These different, specifically Jewish publications want to kind of claim you. I mean, obviously I am Jewish, that’s fine. But I don't know that the identity really carries through in the work in a meaningful way, in its content or interest. People have asked me if I’m interested in Judaica. Sure, I would be. But I haven't come up with anything yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>TB: You came back to season two of</strong><strong><em> Blown Away</em></strong><strong> as a judge. There are some really harsh comments &mdash; I remember in season one, a piece was described as being essentially gift shop kitsch. How do you discern when a piece of glass is something that should be sold in a gift shop, or something that should be in a museum?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>AR: It's a pretty nuanced discussion, because critique for television is really different from critique in any other context, and the constraints of the show are different than just walking into somebody's studio or a classroom. The show has creative briefs, but in a fine arts context, whether a piece fulfills any particular requirement is less of a consideration. And I think critique, in a classroom setting or in general, is to reconcile the intention of the artist with the experience of the group. Art is subjective. People have different responses to different objects. But you can often find in a larger group some consensus that a few things are happening. And then, when the artist or maker compares what they wanted to do with that consensus, they learn. That's what I think critique is for. I’m not sure reality TV critique does that. I would like it to. And that's the point of having those harsher comments. Ultimately it is generous, I think, in trying to help the person understand what happened and how they can do something different the next time. But the problem is in critique, usually nobody wins. There's not a winner. That’s the nature of the two different things. But critique is generous. Maybe the worst critique I've ever gotten is when somebody just has nothing to say at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>TB: I think this speaks to how reality TV as a medium is notoriously distorting. I was curious if you thought there were actually formal similarities between reality TV and glass.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>AR: I’m trying to not say, “That's a good question,” so much, because I've been doing these with some regularity for a while. But that was a good question. Yeah, I think glass really lends itself to the medium of television and reality television. I think any glassblower probably would have told you that ahead of time. There is an inherent performativity in that process &mdash; people gather around when you're working in the shop; they’ll sit down and watch. It's like if somebody was practicing acrobatics in a park: It's a little bit of athleticism, a little bit of choreography. Maybe it's somewhere between someone practicing gymnastics in the park and a balloon animal guy, because there's also this object unfolding over time. And then I think the inherent risk of the process goes really well on camera. People mess up, drop stuff on the floor. Even really, really good people mess up. Any space that you're in, you'll hear an “oooooooh” from the audience, because they’ve invested.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>TB: I definitely made that “oooooh” sound watching it on a screen, in my living room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>AR: Yeah, I love watching other people blow glass. And I also think it’s the weird personalities that end up in the glass shop. These people are made for television. I’m including myself in that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>TB: On a more recent note, I think the pandemic has foreshadowed the environmental crisis in many ways, and I was wondering if the environmental effects of glass are on your mind. I’m thinking especially of </strong><em><u><strong><a href=\"https://alexanderrosenberg.net/Lighting-Prototype-for-Late-Anthropocene\" target=\"_blank\">Lighting Prototype for Late Anthropocene</a></strong></u></em><strong>&nbsp;&mdash; the irony of making a comment on the environment in glass, which is a finite resource.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>AR: Silica sand is definitely facing shortages. And the process is destructive &mdash; a lot of burning fossil fuels. There's a lot of innovation around the equipment, but it's a hard time to be a person that creates objects from the earth. Actually, it's not &mdash; it's a hard time to reconcile the idea that one is producing a lot out of limited materials. It's really been on my mind for the last couple of years, enough that I wrote a new statement about it, and the projects that I've been applying for are around this idea of scarcity and trying to quantify and measure how one’s expenditures affect the environment. So there's a few things that I’m doing and that I think about: Number one, I do believe in this idea of the heirloom &mdash; that making something well and making it special helps to prevent new versions of it from being made in the future. The way we recycle glass in this country is pretty ridiculous. Most of the world washes bottles and reuses them. But we are obsessed with newness. We have to have a bottle that nobody's lips have ever touched, so we have to crush it down and melt it again, which is just a really, really expensive and destructive process. And then also the recycling industry doesn't like glass because it's very heavy. It takes up a lot of room, and it's one of the least valuable materials to be sold in other places. I'm doing a residency right now at a place called <a href=\"https://www.rairphilly.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>RAIR</u></a>&nbsp;[Recycled Artist In Residency] in Philadelphia, where I work with Revolution Recovery, a recycling dump and landfill company. We use the materials that they collect and try to design ways of addressing problems &mdash; food, water, and shelter, basically, like bushcraft with a giant pile of trash. And that's not directly related to glass, but some of the objects that I'm working on are inspired by thinking about glass as an object for human survival, historically. But it’s uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable that the thing that I like to do, the thing that I do the best in the world, is also a thing that's destructive to the world. I don’t have a super great solution for it yet, but it is on my mind, and it's at the root of a lot of the projects I’m working on &mdash; that discomfort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>",

		"body" : "<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Outside Lands took place over Halloweekend this year because of COVID. For some reason everyone decided to dress up as a cowboy, which made me want a cowboy hat more than ever. Did you know Stetson cowboy hats cost hundreds of dollars? Even the straw ones are like $150. I would really like a nice Western hat with a little chin strap. There were a few tents at the festival promoting the new Toyota Mirai, and one of them gave me a free Mirai bucket hat, but I would have rather had a cowboy hat. Anyway, here’s my day-by-day recap of Outside Lands.<br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Friday – Music</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>The first act I saw was The HU, a Mongolian metal band. They are pretty cool. They sing in Mongolian and play traditional Mongolian instruments.</p>\r\n<p>Next, I checked out the beginning of Remi Wolf’s set, but I didn’t stick around because to be honest I don’t really like her songs. But it seemed like other people were having fun.</p>\r\n<p>I was very excited for Sharon Van Etten, but I left after a song or two so that I could interview The HU. I spoke to them through their manager/interpreter, Tuga. Here’s some of what we talked about:</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>AH: You guys are known for combining traditional Mongolian instruments and throat singing with the sounds of heavy metal and folk rock. Do you make any modifications to your instruments to change the sound?</p>\r\n<p>HU: The acoustics, the sound of the music is still the same as our ancestors had played thousands of years ago. But our uniqueness&mdash;the uniqueness of our band&mdash;it's connecting the Eastern with the Western [to make] all of it new. So we made certain design changes on the instruments&mdash;the colors, the shapes&mdash;but the sound is exactly the same.</p>\r\n<p>AH: And those visual changes, do you do them yourselves or do you have someone who modifies them for you?</p>\r\n<p>HU: Our producer, Dashka, has certain good ideas. For example, with the traditional horsehead fiddle, the horse looks at the audience, but we talked about it and thought: Why not have it look at us while we’re playing? So we bring up these ideas, and then there’s somebody who can draw the design and help us bring the ideas to reality.</p>\r\n<p>AH: What do you like to do to pass the time when you’re on tour?</p>\r\n<p>HU: Some of us just work on music. Some of us like to go sightseeing. Some of us like to play cards.</p>\r\n<p>AH: Do you think that being on tour has strengthened your brotherhood and your bond?</p>\r\n<p>HU: Yes, it’s strengthened our brotherhood. Being on the bus 24/7 for over two, three months&mdash;it’s a lot, and we’re like a real family, and we have to look after each other. If one of us gets sick, it can jeopardize the tour, so we really look after each other and try to help each other achieve our potential.</p>\r\n<p>AH: What band are you most excited to see at Outside Lands this weekend?</p>\r\n<p>HU: This music [Sharon Van Etten, which we could hear from the media tent] is beautiful. I love it. Of course, we’re looking forward to seeing The Strokes.</p>\r\n<p>AH: If all of you had to fight each other physically, who would win?</p>\r\n<p>HU: It would probably depend on the day. But we’ve never fought with each other.</p>\r\n<p>AH: When is your next album coming out?</p>\r\n<p>HU: Next year.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Afterwards, I checked out Khruangbin, but I couldn’t get very close, so I couldn’t really see anything, but they sounded fine. When their set ended, I found myself swept up in the mad rush to get closer to the stage for Glass Animals. The lead singer was dressed in a big cable-knit sweater vest. He reminded me of Wallace from <em>Wallace & Gromit,</em> probably because of the sweater vest and because he is British. His pants, which were white with a few applique cherries, reminded me of a pair my sister has from Lisa Says Gah. Someone was blowing bubbles during the set. I looked up at them and thought, I am at the bottom of a champagne glass. Soon, someone will drink me or I will go flat.</p>\r\n<p>The vaporwave visuals and props onstage were fun. However, I think the audio people might have done a really bad job, because I could barely hear anything over the bass. It’s possible that it was just me and the resonant frequency of my ribcage, though. A source from the Clean Vibes volunteer trash pickup crew told me that Glass Animals sounded great from the VIP section.</p>\r\n<p>The Strokes and Tyler, The Creator played at the same time. I stayed for The Strokes because they played at the same stage as Glass Animals, and I think I made the wrong decision. I should have heeded people’s warnings that The Strokes are underwhelming live. They sounded kind of like a moderately talented group of karaoke singers, and Julian Casablancas was unable to stop himself from being rambling obnoxiously about inane bullshit between songs.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Friday – Food</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Borsch Mobile: Potato dumplings and kvass, which tastes kind of like nonalcoholic beer. Pretty good.</p>\r\n<p>Alicia’s Tamales: When I went to Outside Lands in 2017, I had a spiritual experience while eating tamales from Alicia’s Tamales. I don’t remember which tamales I ordered that time, but I think there was cheese and prickly pear. Unfortunately, the tamales I got this time were not as good, but they were still decent. I got one Oaxaca cheese and one vegan veggie. I think the vegan veggie could have used more prickly pear. I love prickly pear.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Saturday – Music</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>I don’t remember a lot from Andrew McMahon other than the fact that he climbed onto his piano and walked on the keys. Why would you do that? Afterwards I saw Dr. Dog. I think this is supposed to be their farewell tour. There was a huge crowd and I couldn’t really see much. I also think the sound on the Sutro stage was pretty shit because I couldn’t hear much either.</p>\r\n<p>Later, I saw Angel Olsen. I don’t really like her two newest albums as much as her previous ones, and I don’t like her newest EP, which is all covers. I’m a simple girl and I like Angel Olsen songs that you can sing along to. I’m glad she performed “Spring,” which is pretty much the only song I like from <em>All Mirrors</em>.</p>\r\n<p>The last act I saw on Saturday was The Midnight, a synthwave band from LA. I liked the saxophone bits. I heard part of Lizzo’s set on my way out of Golden Gate Park. She was probably good, but I was way too tired to stay any longer.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Saturday&nbsp;– Food</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Vegan Mob: I ordered the collard greens with baked beans and soy brisket but they gave me someone else’s order so I ended up with soy brisket, baked beans, and mac and (vegan) cheese. I would never have ordered vegan mac and cheese because the undeniable reality is that all vegan cheese tastes bad. Sometimes vegan cheese is so bad it’s inedible&mdash;never buy the Follow Your Heart brand because it tastes like burnt plastic. In this case, the vegan cheese was tolerable. The soy brisket was quite good, though a bit too salty for my taste. The baked beans were fine, but the portion size was laughably small.</p>\r\n<p>Marley’s Treats: The ube cheesecake topped with flan was way too small to cost seven dollars but it tasted amazing.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Sunday – Music</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>I thought it was funny that Neal Francis and Neil Frances played back to back on the Panhandle stage, but I didn’t think it was funny enough for me to see either of them. Instead, I saw Claud, the first artist to sign with Phoebe Bridgers’ new label, Saddest Factory. Claud was fun, but I think their vocals got drowned out sometimes. I like their song “Overnight,” which is about being a simp and getting with your crush. I also like “Soft Spot,” which made me think about how having a soft spot for someone can also be like having a rotten bit that you have to cut out with a paring knife so that the rest of you is still edible. (The lyrics don’t make this comparison explicitly, but you can hear it in the delivery.)</p>\r\n<p>I watched some of Cannons’ set from the media tent while I waited to interview Claud. (They eventually canceled on me, but it’s fine.) I liked Cannons’ costumes and makeup. They reminded me of ABBA, but their songs were forgettable. Afterwards, I saw Yves Tumor and Its Band. I liked them a lot even though I didn’t know any of their songs. I left Yves Tumor early to meet up with some people who were watching mxmtoon. I have to say I made the wrong decision. I’ve always wanted to like mxmtoon because she’s around my age and went to the same high school as a bunch of people I know, but I just don’t like her songs. I’m sorry. I tried. It’s just that she doesn’t sound good enough to make up for her boring lyrics. I liked her costume though. She was Steve from <em>Blue’s Clues.</em></p>\r\n<p>I don’t know why there was such a huge crowd for Sofi Tukker. I had literally never heard of them before. Honestly, they sound like hot garbage. Their songs are incredibly repetitive and the lyrics are shit. My boyfriend is actually playing Sofi Tukker right now and saying that he will continue to play their songs until I finish writing about them (so that I will be motivated to write more quickly). I’m going to leave it at that.</p>\r\n<p>Tame Impala was great. They played a fun trippy intro video and had a cool light show. I liked the bit they did where they pretended to be The Wiggles. (The Wiggles did a really good cover of “Elephant” earlier this year.) During the set, two very tall guys dressed as British redcoats took turns sitting on each other’s shoulders, and seeing them stacked on top of each other like that made me think about millipedes.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Sunday – Food</strong></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Lazy Susan: I ordered the Impossible&trade; mapo chili cheese fries thinking that there would be tofu contained therein, but actually it was just a plate of cheese fries with some fake meat in mapo sauce. I did not like it very much and gave most of it away.</p>\r\n<p>Marley’s Treats: I got a big ube cookie stuffed with flan. It was a lot bigger than the ube cheesecake with flan, so the $7 price was a bit more justifiable, but the cheesecake was definitely better. I wish that there had been more flan in the cookie.</p>\r\n<p>Suppenküche: The vegan currywurst was so good! But it was also tiny. I thought German portion sizes were supposed to be big. Definitely not worth whatever we paid for it.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairman: The <a href=\"http://www.hailthechairman.com/\">name and theme</a> are cringeworthy and honestly kind of racist but we were hungry and had to eat. The miso cured tofu steamed buns were good. I think there were some ribbons of raw Chinese greens, which were surprisingly tasty.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, Halloweekend Outside Lands was pretty cool. Some people want Outside Lands to be on Halloweekend every year, but I disagree. I sure am glad I got to go, but personally I think summertime Outside Lands just feels more correct. It was so cold this year, and the ground was marshy. The End.</p>",

As the singer revealed later that night, it would turn out to be the biggest show he's ever played.</p>\r\n<p>Not one to shy away from a challenge, FINNEAS showed off his impressive stage presence in every song, dabbling in a range of stage personas that made for an exciting and raw performance.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pmbkdR-L1WouolJ7wi9VRA4RU4LeYWgbHL8-TCTZOofanAVbbahZZLTqgaMtTLDbM0rssGbrnWPFMoKMQcKyAYWdUHaB2PSpq3sjCH_UGEYTLQch3cFx9h4V2s9utf1fA6CXhYQ6\" width=\"357\" height=\"627\"></p>\r\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>From the moment the curtain lifted, the audience were immediately confronted with FINNEAS at center stage, channeling ‘70s rocker vibes in his flowy black shirt and bootcut slacks. The show capitalized on this center-surround stage design, which featured a three tiered level that separated Eric Forrest on the keyboard, bass, and guitars from Andrew Marshall on the drums. The lack of negative space on stage also allowed FINNEAS to get closer to the audience, from clasping eager hands of screaming fans to harmonizing with the crowd’s adlibs on the chorus of “Happy Now.” The lighting also played into the thematic progression of the songs. While slower songs like “Angel” had the twinkling lights radiating from the piano, upbeat bangers like “Claudia” achieved a larger-than-life effect with the pulsating strobe and strip lights. In this way, the concert simultaneously took advantage of the small stage to both create an intimate atmosphere and amp up the energy.</p>\r\n<p>These stage effects paralleled the dichotomy of the “Optimist” as an album, alternating between soulful love ballads and ironically cheerful sounding songs.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Me472vbbrW7ZtGmOX6UK54uTdd2laVhFty59BhEJL8bDeydjRYu7LjeGX4H9-Wnq69m4oW2jrqbz3Ix5QB3dr6IxYnWsLN9_8if9QqyCoFcc7Ja3OxrWCQwBEVRnce3f1MdhjNwe\" width=\"624\" height=\"832\"></p>\r\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>On upbeat tracks like “The Kids Are All Dying,” which had FINNEAS shuffling side to side with swagger, it was clear that he was feeling himself, thriving from the energy in the crowd. Then there were the nostalgic moments like in “Only Lifetime,” where the lights dimmed and phone flashlights lit up the House of Blues to emphasize the sentimentality of the heartfelt lyric “Don’t waste the time you have.” The strategic musical progression from “I Don’t Miss You at All” to “Shelter” highlighted the 808-beat quality on both of these bass heavy tracks, showcasing the signature flair of FINNEAS’ production. By following up these tracks with serenade-like “Partners in Crime” and the melodic “Love Is Pain,” FINNEAS put his musical and vocal range on full display.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/41TRXlcVXDf5li4fMGpwQIbEGfFBQI_gIYczWZlu8obveb3l9pKXOoQHl0uvwn__56kLyjvQifl9or7hUCoHgRTqwfFNrfaL3yTPrEK5uUGtZmWfKlEPWSO6TdX6xMXI1SZaRl21\" width=\"624\" height=\"832\"></p>\r\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>FINNEAS also facilitated the crowd with the charisma of a seasoned performer.&nbsp;<br></p><p>He beckoned the audience to sing along to “What They’ll Say About Us” during the buildup to the pivotal thematic shift to the collective we in lyrics like, “We have the time.” He then coaxed the hushed crowd into chanting “I’m fine” in “Break My Heart Again” and singing along with “Maybe you’re all I’ve ever wanted” in “Lost My Mind.” Then, with the interjection of faster-paced songs like “How It Ends,” FINNEAS hyped up the crowd by jumping up on the piano to dance to the funky beat under the disco ball lights. This song offered not only a musical outro but an atmospheric interlude as the setlist transitioned into his EP “Blood Harmony.” Ironic and candid personal notes like the lines “Cause he made a little too much money to be twenty and sad” in “I Lost a Friend” and “Hate how easy they can find me just by looking up my mom’s address” in “The 90s’” were brought out by climactic cymbal crashing beat drops and electric guitar streaks, making the performance feel that much more personal and authentic. “I guess there’s nothing more romantic than dying with your friends” sounded just as “Till Forever Falls Apart” played, when FINNEAS dedicated all of his love to the Boston crowd after receiving a hand drawn portrait from a fan in between these songs. For the final song, the jubilant crowd raised middle fingers high to the exultant lyric “fuck that noise” in “Let’s Fall in Love for the Night.” As his last performance in the U.S. ended on a high, FINNEAS himself noted that this was his best concert “hands down.”</p>\r\n<p>FINNEAS really lived up to his first solo performance. The nostalgia of having been fourteen years old in a band, just dreaming about putting on shows like these, wasn’t lost on him. He is growing into an immense stage persona as he carves out a name for himself on this tour.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Photos by Luke Fenstemaker</p>",

		"slug" : "in-joan-is-okay-a-doctor-rearticulates-her-relationship-to-work",
		"body" : "<p><del></del>“When I think about people, I think about space, how much space a person takes up and how much use that person provides,” begins <em>Joan is Okay</em> by Weike Wang. Our narrator is Joan, a thirty-six-year-old Chinese-American whose life happily revolves around the New York City hospital ICU, where she works as a physician. But when her father dies unexpectedly from a stroke, and her mother returns to America from China to “become friends” with her children, and her brother and sister-in-law mount pressure on her to settle down in the suburbs and start a family, and the coronavirus pandemic shuts all life down, Joan is forced to question her workaholism and define her own cultural beliefs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Binaries give structure and conflict to the story: Joan and her brother, work life and domestic life, America and China, present and past. Where Joan wants nothing more than to be an unnoticed cog in a machine, her brother Fang aspires only to climb ladders. “This is our chance,” he tells Joan during her undergraduate studies at Harvard, “don’t throw it away.” In the present, he and his wife Tami foist their own expectations for family and community over and over on a resistant Joan. Her new next-door neighbor, Mark, does the same but with entertainment&mdash;he unloads a green suede chair, then stacks and stacks of books, then an old TV onto her so she can watch <em>Seinfeld</em> and orient herself in American culture. She is perturbed by his eagerness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Joan feels familiar, if a little exaggerated. (It’s hard to imagine anyone who has gone through at least fifteen years of schooling to not have at least heard of John Steinbeck.) She is one archetype of Asian America, the child of immigrants who strives above all to find control in a country to which her existence has only ever been peripheral. “It wasn’t glory that had drawn me to healthcare but the chance to feel pure and complete drudgery in my pursuit of use,” she explains.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In fact, most characters are archetypes. Fang is a hedge-fund manager with an unspoken inferiority complex, who takes all opportunities to show off his wealth. Reese, one of Joan’s fellow physicians, constantly makes unintentional offhand remarks about Joan’s gender; Mark, though well-meaning, continually oversteps boundaries. “[They were] brought up with different rules,” Joan gripes of Reese and Mark; “yes, push back, provoke, assert yourself, some trouble is good, since the rest of us will always go easy on you and, if anything, reward you for being you.” Whereas she, the daughter of immigrants, “is a daughter of guests, is a part time guest herself, and the best kind of guest goes with the flow.”</p>\r\n<p>But just because the characters are archetypal doesn’t mean they’re simplistic. Forced to contend with conflicting viewpoints on family, work, and identity in one place, Joan begins to articulate her own. She cannot change who she is, and she cannot expect herself to change others. “Why try to explain yourself to someone with no capacity to listen?” Others might find fulfillment in family or marriage; her fulfillment is work. This experience of being misunderstood provides a heightened level of understanding of those around her. When the coronavirus pandemic hits and frustrates Joan’s mother’s attempts to book a flight back to China, and Fang and Tami begin treating her increasingly carefully to entice her to stay, it is Joan who realizes what her mother is unable to say&mdash;“Just because I’ve lost my husband doesn’t mean I’ve lost my mind, and what I need help with is not money or food, it is something else entirely.”</p>\r\n<p>The emotional core of the book is built through similar sharp epiphanies. Weike Wang’s writing is precise and measured, just like Joan herself. The prose does not draw attention to itself, as Joan would not want herself as the center of any story, but the characters come alive underneath. Told in a series of brief linked episodes, the story moves seamlessly between Joan’s experiences in the present and her childhood memories, indicating how memory informs experience and present emotion is continuous with past emotion. We slowly realize that the binaries are not so binary after all: Joan cannot be separated from her roots, which are part of who she is. We are right there with Joan as she remembers her father abandoning his frugality to take his family around town in a money-green Mustang for a day. Or as she shares the out-of-place feeling with her mother, who has freshly returned from China, in her brother’s grand gated house in Greenwich. Understated but quietly powerful, these snapshots stay with me long after I’ve closed the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the end, no facet of Joan’s life is left behind. What makes <em>Joan is Okay</em> special is how complex and all-encompassing it is. The story is not just about Joan and her grief, not just about Joan and motherhood, not just about Joan and her work, not just about Joan and her Asian-Americanness&mdash;but altogether, a person in her entirety, handled with nuance, an incredible balancing act.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When praising her work ethic, the director of the hospital once likens Joan to a spinning cassette tape, dependable and constant. Joan A to Joan B, Joan B to Joan A. It’s a comparison that denies her directionality. By the end of the story, however, Joan is in a decidedly different place from where she started. Her relationships with her family and coworkers have transformed, and though not all her issues are resolved, Joan is finding her balance. Joan will be okay.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><em>This book was provided as a NetGalley from Random House.&nbsp;</em></p>",

		"slug" : "melt-fills-sold-out-brighton-music-hall",
		"body" : "<p>There was no shortage of Docs in the line piling up outside Brighton Music Hall on Friday, December 10. A group of friends passed around a vape. Someone walked by wearing rare band merch, a custom blue long sleeve tour shirt. For a fan to obtain this shirt, they would have had to enter a special two-hundred-member group chat, join a vote to decide the shirt’s color, and obtain a password for Melt’s website. Though fans were excited, there was no jostling to get into the venue.&nbsp;<br></p>\r\n<p>Melt’s first headliner tour began in October 2021 and had the band traveling up and down the East Coast, an activity the members are no stranger to. In the past few years, its members have attended colleges dispersed across the greater New England area. New York City influences much of the band’s songwriting &mdash; many band members consider it their hometown. The sextet features Veronica Stewart-Frommer on vocals, Eric Gabriel on vocals & keys, Marlo Shankweiler on guitar, Josh Greenzeig on drums, Lucas Saur on bass, and Nick Sare on sax. For this performance, Evan Lane stepped in on trumpet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Inside, the crowd flocked towards the stage, packed almost shoulder-to-shoulder. Opening for Melt was The Brazen Youth, with Mei Semones playing some especially captivating solos on the guitar. In the interim, The B-52’s “Rock Lobster” blasted over the speakers.</p>\r\n<p>And then Melt walked on, frontperson Stewart-Frommer entering in a big furry brown coat which she promptly shed. The lead singer’s pants matched the guitarist’s patterned top perfectly as they launched into Shy, their 2020 single. Eric Gabriel joined Stewart-Frommer on vocals for “Oh Brother.” (Throughout the concert, a personal cheering section could be heard screaming encouragement at Eric.)</p>\r\n<p>Following was an unnamed new song, then “Plant,\" and “Stupid in Love,\" a reflection on a relationship that has flatlined: “I've never been superstitious / But I'll take what I can get / So I'm knocking on wood and sleeping with clovers in my bed [&hellip;] We don't talk like we used to / No more late night calls / I've been building bridges while you're putting up walls.”&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The lead singer took a break from her impressive belting, using her lower register for the timely and catchy “West Side Highway,” a product of life in 2020 New York City. The song reflects on protests, lockdown, and with the lyric \"See my city coming together / like they did when I was just two years old,” facing calamity in a post-9/11 world.</p>\r\n<p>Next was the groovy and danceable “Inside.” Though I loved the song, I was standing near the speakers and winced at the occasional feedback echoes. I noticed the person next to me disappear but didn't think much of it until she pressed a set of ear plugs into my hand. They matched her own.</p>\r\n<p>After an instrumental jam, Gabriel took the lead on vocals with “Whirlpool,\" and the crowd sang along to a cover of Bill Withers’ “Ain't No Sunshine.” Stewart-Frommer is active in nuclear non-proliferation and is a fellow with Beyond the Bomb, a grassroots organization dedicated to preventing nuclear war. She explained that the band received a box containing a thousand condoms through a partnership with Beyond the Bomb, which they were tasked to distribute, encouraging their audience and the public to “make love not war.” As band members enthusiastically threw condoms into the crowd, fans caught them with equal fervor.</p>\r\n<p>Melt played more songs off their debut EP, <em>West Side Highway</em>: “Hours,” “Don't Want Me.” Stewart-Frommer’s effervescent stage presence was complemented by a playful brass section composed of Lane and Sare. The band finished up with “Never Be Alone,\" and “Waves,” saying their thank yous and leaving the stage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The crowd chanted “One more song!” and the band came trooping back out. The encore was “Brown Eyes” and fan favorite, “Sour Candy,\" the 2017 single which reached #5 on Billboard‘s US Viral 50 Chart and catapulted the band into the hearts of many, including mine. The night ended, swathed in Melt’s psychedelic funk-pop-soul fusion sound, chill and energetic and charmingly collective. </p>",

Not much is known about this image other than that it has suffered emulsion from decades of improper storage in a barn.</em><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Hugh Magnum (1897-1922).&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>Untitled 27,&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>date unknown Archival pigment print 17 x 12.5 inches\r\nImage courtesy of ACA Galleries and MB Abram Galleries</strong></p>\r\n<p>Two pairs of inquisitive eyes pierce through a dappled layer of blue and grey film, seemingly demanding answers from me. I’m not sure what they’re asking or what kind of answers they are expecting, but there is an urgent curiosity to their gaze that immediately arrests me, and also haunts me. I can’t shake a strange feeling of disorientation: the image feels old, spectral, but at the same time, the two sitters and their insistent eyes seem intractably present and contemporary. The image has been “ruined” by some kind of chemical reaction, which is to say it’s been made</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"blob:https://blog.theharvardadvocate.com/19c3525e-9fd8-4b3b-aee8-da2c26e029ac\" alt=\"Hugh Magnum (1897-1922).

Though the sitters’ faces are half obscured by this emulsion in the film, they refuse to surrender to the blur of textures that swarm the frame. They rise above the image.</p>\r\n<p>This isn’t like any turn-of-the-century studio portrait. Gone is the typical stiffness, which has been evacuated from image by animacy and life force. I begin to observe the rhythm of the work more carefully, allowing myself to get caught up in its swirl of crackling patterns that dance above, around, and within the faces. It’s almost as if the two sitters are caught in a blaze of blue fire. Ironically, it is the violence of the emulsion&mdash;which some might interpret as the death of the photograph&mdash;that makes the image feel so alive. As I trace the almost psychedelic patterning, I can’t resist the feeling that this is a sentient image, that the chemical changes testify to some kind of life.</p>\r\n<p>And then I am called back to where I began: the faces. Simultaneously embedded in and set apart from the fiery patterns, their faces are still, placidly self assured, measuredly cool. Of course our sitters could not predict that this image would become what it is now, but it is hard not to read the calm of their faces against the panicked patterns that texture the photograph. I imagine the history of the image unfolding as if in a timelapse video. A grey background grows bespeckled with blue, its wholeness becoming increasingly fragmented by these dazzling accidental abstractions. But at every moment overtime, the visages of our two sitters remain constant, meeting the world with the same urgency as they do today in the gallery.</p>\r\n<p>I don’t linger in front of this image. It lingers with me. As I turn away from the photograph, towards the exit of the gallery, my imagination is awash with questions about who these two women might be. How did they come to Magnum’s studio? How did they know eachother? Were they related? What were they thinking at the moment Magnum captured this image? It dawns on me that I won’t be forgetting this image, or the two women living inside it, any time soon.</p>",
